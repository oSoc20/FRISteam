A method for the simultaneous measurement of exposure biomarkers of di(2-propylheptyl) phthalate (DPHP), di(isononyl)cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH), di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHTP) and di-2-ethylhexyl adipate (DEHA) in hair samples was developed and validated in this study. Prior to the analysis, the hair samples were washed in acetone and ultrapure water and pulverized to powder. Further, a solid-liquid and solid-phase extraction, followed by quantification using liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed. The method was validated in terms of recovery, matrix effects, carry-over, linearity, limits of quantification, within- and between-run precision and trueness. Satisfying results were obtained for all targeted compounds, except for mono(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (MEHA), which was monitored only qualitatively. The optimized method was implemented in a pilot biomonitoring study with hair samples from 9 healthy volunteers. Detection frequencies of seven metabolites ranged from 11% to 100%. Mono(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (MEHTP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) adipate (oxo-MEHA) were found in all hair samples. More hydrophobic monoester metabolites were found to be incorporated in hair to a greater extent compared to their oxidized counterparts. Obtained results show that the developed method can detect AP metabolites in hair, supporting the use of this alternative matrix in human biomonitoring."}}{"id": "115f7b19-90df-459e-88f7-abe87ca1b695", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157594", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Overcoming intrinsic and acquired cetuximab resistance in RAS wild-type colorectal cancer", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers11010098", "abstract": {"id": 164968693, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important therapeutic target in colorectal cancer (CRC). After the initial promising results of EGFR-targeted therapies such as cetuximab, therapeutic resistance poses a challenging problem and limits the success of effective anti-EGFR cancer therapies in the clinic. In order to overcome resistance to these EGFR-targeted therapies, new treatment options are necessary. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of human epidermal growth factor (HER) receptors and the efficacy of afatinib, a second-generation irreversible EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in RAS wild-type CRC cell lines with different cetuximab sensitivities. CRC cell lines with different sensitivities to cetuximab showed rather low EGFR expression but high HER2 and HER3 expression. These results were in line with the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data from CRC patients, where higher mRNA levels of HER2 and HER3 were also detected compared to EGFR. Therefore, the targets of afatinib were indeed expressed on the CRC cell lines used in this study and in CRC patients. Furthermore, cetuximab resistance had no significant influence on the expression levels of HER receptors in CRC cell lines (p &amp;gt;&amp;#61; 0.652). This study also demonstrated that afatinib was able to induce a concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect in RAS wild-type CRC cell lines with different cetuximab sensitivities. Neither cetuximab resistance (p &amp;#61; 0.233) nor hypoxia (p &amp;#61; 0.157) significantly influenced afatinib&amp;#39;s cytotoxic effect. In conclusion, our preclinical data support the hypothesis that treatment with afatinib might be a promising novel therapeutic strategy for CRC patients experiencing intrinsic and acquired cetuximab resistance."}}{"id": "ff6809c6-b49a-475c-8936-5005918a153a", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157584", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Schwarz on tax treaties, 5th Edition", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": null, "abstract": null}{"id": "ec688e0a-ab52-4927-95ed-d08f76d2e2e9", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157560", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Methylglyoxal, a glycolysis metabolite, triggers metastasis through MEK/ERK/SMAD1 pathway activation in breast cancer", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13058-018-1095-7", "abstract": {"id": 164966049, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "BackgroundElevated aerobic glycolysis rate is a biochemical alteration associated with malignant transformation and cancer progression. This metabolic shift unavoidably generates methylglyoxal (MG), a potent inducer of dicarbonyl stress through the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). We have previously shown that the silencing of glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), the main MG detoxifying enzyme, generates endogenous dicarbonyl stress resulting in enhanced growth and metastasis in vivo. However, the molecular mechanisms through which MG stress promotes metastasis development remain to be unveiled.MethodsIn this study, we used RNA sequencing analysis to investigate gene-expression profiling of GLO1-depleted breast cancer cells and we validated the regulated expression of selected genes of interest by RT-qPCR. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated the acquisition of a pro-metastatic phenotype related to dicarbonyl stress in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 breast cancer cellular models. Hyperactivation of MEK/ERK/SMAD1 pathway was evidenced using western blotting upon endogenous MG stress and exogenous MG treatment conditions. MEK and SMAD1 regulation of MG pro-metastatic signature genes in breast cancer cells was demonstrated by RT-qPCR.ResultsHigh-throughput transcriptome profiling of GLO1-depleted breast cancer cells highlighted a pro-metastatic signature that establishes novel connections between MG dicarbonyl stress, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling by neoplastic cells and enhanced cell migration. Mechanistically, we showed that these metastasis-related processes are functionally linked to MEK/ERK/SMAD1 cascade activation in breast cancer cells. We showed that sustained MEK/ERK activation in GLO1-depleted cells notably occurred through the down-regulation of the expression of dual specificity phosphatases in MG-stressed breast cancer cells. The use of carnosine and aminoguanidine, two potent MG scavengers, reversed MG stress effects in in vitro and in vivo experimental settings.ConclusionsThese results uncover for the first time the key role of MG dicarbonyl stress in the induction of ECM remodeling and the activation of migratory signaling pathways, both in favor of enhanced metastatic dissemination of breast cancer cells. Importantly, the efficient inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling using MG scavengers further emphasizes the need to investigate their therapeutic potential across different malignancies."}}{"id": "2fa6e1f8-438f-40d5-9a69-8fcb64168448", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157546", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Short communication", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-15514", "abstract": {"id": 164961353, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "Both the sensitivity of an estrus detection system and the consistency of alarms relative to ovulation determine its value for a farmer. The objective of this study was to compare an activity-based system and a milk progesterone-based system for their ability to detect estrus reliably, and to investigate how their alerts are linked to the time of the LH surge preceding ovulation. The study was conducted on an experimental research farm in Flanders, Belgium. The activity alerts were generated by a commercial activity meter (ActoFIT, DeLaval, Tumba, Sweden), and milk progesterone was measured using a commercial ELISA kit. Sensitivity and positive predictive value of both systems were calculated based on 35 estrus periods over 43 d. Blood samples were taken for determination of the LH surge, and the intervals between timing of the alerts and the LH surge were investigated based on their range and standard deviation (SD). Activity alerts had a sensitivity of 80% and a positive predictive value of 65.9%. Alerts were detected from 39 h before until 8 h after the LH surge (range: 47 h, SD: 16 h). Alerts based on milk progesterone were obtained from a recently developed monitoring algorithm using a mathematical model and synergistic control. All estruses were correctly identified by this algorithm, and the LH surge followed, on average, 62 h later. Using the mathematical model, model-based indicators for the estimation of ovulation time can be calculated. Depending on which modelbased indicator was used, ranges of 33 to 35 h and SD of about 11 h were obtained. Because detection of the LH surge was very labor intensive, only a limited number of potential estrus periods could be studied."}}{"id": "44202fab-c697-44e2-a79d-209098293718", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157541", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Transmission electron microscopy study of complex oxide scales on DIN 1.4970 steel exposed to liquid Pb-Bi eutectic", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.corsci.2018.10.018", "abstract": {"id": 164961292, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "The deployment of Gen-IV lead-cooled fast reactors requires a good compatibility between the selected structural/cladding steels and the inherently corrosive heavy liquid metal coolant.

Methods: A convenience sample of 108 persons with MS was studied, distinguished in three disability subgroups based on Disease Steps (DS). Health condition was assessed by standardized clinical tests about physical, cognitive and psychosocial functioning. Contextual factors (personal and environmental) were collected. Activity-related travel diaries and GPS tracking devices were used to investigate activity-related travel behaviour in terms of number of trips and transport modes used. The influence of health condition measures and contextual factors with activityrelated travel behaviour measures was analyzed using Spearman correlations and multiple linear regressions. Results: 1. Activity-related travel behaviour in MS decreased significantly with increasing ambulatory dysfunction. Significant changes were found regarding travel modes, number, type and planning of activities. 2. Activity-related travel behaviour in MS correlated with both health condition measures and contextual factors. A limited number of standardized tests of health condition and contextual factors (driving ability, household size) can predict activity-related travel behaviour in MS. Conclusions: Both health condition (mostly physical functioning) and contextual factors are predictive for activity-related travel behaviour in MS.

The purpose of this paper is to diagnose and detect the bursting of shipping bubbles ex ante, and to qualify the patterns of shipping price dynamics and the bubble mechanics, so that appropriate counter measures can be taken in advance to reduce side effects arising from bubbles. Design/methodology/approach - Log periodic power law (LPPL) model, developed in the past decade, is used to detect large market falls or &amp;#34;crashes&amp;#34; through modeling of the shipping price dynamics on a selection of three historical shipping bubbles over the period of 1985 to 2016. The method is based on a nonlinear least squares estimation that yields predictions of the most probable time of the regime switching. Findings - It could be concluded that predictions by the LPPL model are quite dependent on the time at which they are conducted. Interestingly, the LPPL model could have predicted the substantial fall in the Baltic Dry Index during the recent global downturn, but not all crashes in the past. It is also found that the key ingredient that sets off an unsustainable growth process for shipping prices is the positive feedback. When the positive feedback starts, the burst of bubbles in shipping would be influenced by both endogenous and exogenous factors, which are crucial for the advanced warning of the market conversion. Originality/value - The LPPL model has been first applied into the dry bulk shipping market to test a couple of shipping bubbles. The authors not only assess the predictability and robustness of the LPPL model but also expand the understanding of the model and explain patterns of shipping price dynamics and bubble mechanics."}}{"id": "46444df7-ad5c-4a5e-8c4b-e9746831e2de", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157650", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Effect of foliar bio-fertilization on growth and biochemical parameters of olive trees at flowering", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2018.1500592", "abstract": {"id": 164911900, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "Growth and biochemical parameters of leaves, flower buds and flowers of olive (Olea europaea L. cv.

The importance of genetic and environmental factors to these associations is unclear. Objective: The objective was to examine the importance of genetic and environmental factors in the associations between infant growth and adult cardiometabolic risk factors (anthropometric characteristics, lipids, insulin sensitivity, leptin, blood pressure, and fibrinogen) in twins. Design: Cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed in 240 twin pairs (aged 1834 y) from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. Infant growth was defined as change in weight z score. We regressed intrapair differences in growth during 4 growth windows (01, 16, 612, and 1224 mo) against intrapair differences in the risk factors in monozygotic and dizygotic twins separately. Results: Within monozygotic twin pairs only, associations between infant growth and most adult lipids, glucose, leptin, and blood pressure (eg, systolic blood pressure: b &amp;#61; 5.95 mm Hg per change in z score, P &amp;#61; 0.01 in monozygotic twins; b &amp;#61; \u00e2\u02c6\u20191.64, P &amp;#61; 0.82 in dizygotic twins from 12 to 24 mo) were found.

We evaluated whether neonatal sepsis can be predicted from antepartum parameters in these women. Study design We used multivariable logistic regression to develop a prediction model. Data were obtained from two recent randomized controlled trials on induction of labor versus expectant management in late preterm PROM (PPROMEXIL trials, (ISRCTN29313500 and ISRCTN05689407). Data from randomized as well as non-randomized women, who consented to the use of their medical data, were used. We evaluated 13 potential antepartum predictors for neonatal sepsis. Missing data were imputed. Discriminative ability of the model was expressed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and a calibration with both a calibration plot and the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Overall performance of the prediction model was quantified as the scaled Brier score. Results We studied 970 women. Thirty-three (3.4%) neonates suffered neonatal sepsis. Maternal age (OR 1.09 per year), maternal CRP level (OR 1.01 per mmol/l), maternal temperature (OR 1.80 per \u00c2\u00b0C) and positive GBS culture (OR 2.20) were associated with an increased risk of neonatal sepsis. The model had an area under the ROC-curve of 0.71. The model had both a good calibration and accuracy.

Methods and Results Data were retrospectively collected from September 1989 until July 2011 of all IPF patients registered for LTX in the Netherlands. Patients were included after revision of the diagnosis based on the criteria set by the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT. Trajectory data, clinical data at time of screening, and donor data were collected. In total, 98 IPF patients were listed for LTX. During the waiting list period, 30 % of the patients died. Mean pulmonary artery pressure, 6-min walking distance, and the use of supplemental oxygen were significant predictors of mortality on the waiting list. Fifty-two patients received LTX with a median overall survival after transplantation of 10 years. Conclusions This study demonstrated a 10-year survival time after LTX in IPF. Furthermore, our study demonstrated a significantly better survival after bilateral LTX in IPF compared to single LTX although bilateral LTX patients were significantly younger."}}{"id": "ba82c1a7-16d1-4518-a6b2-de9428ea7bef", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157308", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Extensive pulmonary sarcoid reaction in a patient with bmpr-2 associated idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": null, "abstract": {"id": 164471837, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive life-threatening disease characterized by vascular remodeling.

Most previous studies have reported improved HRQoL shortly after LTx. With regard to long-term effects on HRQoL, however, the evidence is less solid. This prospective cohort study was started with 828 patients who were on the waiting list for LTx. Then, in a longitudinal follow-up, 370 post-LTx patients were evaluated annually for up to 15years. For all wait-listed and follow-up patients, the following four HRQoL instruments were administered: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, Nottingham Health Profile, and a visual analogue scale. Cross-sectional and generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis for repeated measures were performed to assess changes in HRQoL during follow-up. After LTx, patients showed improvement in all HRQoL domains except pain, which remained steady throughout the long-term follow-up. The level of anxiety and depressive symptoms decreased significantly and remained constant. In conclusion, this study showed that HRQoL improves after LTx and tends to remain relatively constant for the entire life span.

The analysis revealed that organic-neurogenic FAS is more frequent in women than in men. In organic-neurogenic FAS over half of the patients acquired the foreign accent after a stroke. Their lesions are typically located in the left supratentorial regions of the brain, and generally involve the primary motor cortex and premotor cortex (BA 4 and 6), and/or the basal ganglia. Although neurocognitive data are not consistently reported, vascular FAS patients regularly suffer frontal executive dysfunctions. On the basis of a careful comparison of the cognitive and theoretical accounts of FAS, AoS and ataxic dysarthria, it is concluded that FAS should be regarded a dual component motor speech disorder in which both planning and motor execution of speech may be affected."}}{"id": "7b76b366-a103-4545-ba3b-9ac2f2c7f4ec", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:153457", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Qualitative comparative analysis as an evaluation tool", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1098214017710502", "abstract": {"id": 164470329, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is gaining ground in evaluation circles, but the number of applications is still limited.

Together, through cooperation, economies of scale can be realised that facilitate a modal shift away from road to a more efficient and more sustainable transport. This would reduce the cost of transport to/from the hinterland region from/to these ports consequently increasing the attractiveness and the market share of the cooperating ports for this region. The paper describes a conceptual method to identify and quantify the opportunities for cooperation in the hinterland. The framework starts, after some basic transport economic concepts, from (theoretically available) hinterland data to locate regions that are at the edge of the contested hinterland of a port region and results in a methodology that can be used to generate a quantified list of regions where cooperation will make a difference. Using this methodology, port authorities (PAs), of any region where hinterland data are available, can list, together with their neighbours, the regions where to prioritise their efforts."}}{"id": "afd33f8d-c318-4edd-8273-aeaa03ade14f", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:156823", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Re-imagining DEFA.

The mechanisms of elevated competitiveness of rape under the future climate consisted of better antioxidative protection, particularly elevated total antioxidative capacity and activities of peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase. Whereas stronger oxidative damage, disproportionally high activities of H2O2 scavenging enzymes and lower pool of soluble sugars in mixed-culture wild mustard reduced its competitiveness under FC &amp;#43; O3 conditions.

The proportional variability (PV) index was developed to solve some of the CV&amp;#39;s drawbacks, but, so far, no variability index takes into account the chronological order of the values in time series. In this paper, we introduce the consecutive disparity index (D), a temporal variability index that takes into account the chronological order of the values, assessing the average rate of change between consecutive values. We used computer simulations and empirical data for fruit production in trees, bird counts, and rodent captures to compare the behavior of D, PV, and CV under different scenarios. D was sensitive to changes in temporal autocorrelation in the negative autocorrelation range, and CV and PV were sensitive in the positive autocorrelation range despite not considering the chronological order of the values. The CV, however, was highly dependent on the mean of the time series, while D and PV were not. Our results demonstrate that, like PV, D solves many of the problems of the CV index while taking into account the chronological order of values in time series. The mathematical and statistical features of D make it a suitable index for analyzing temporal variability in a wide range of ecological studies."}}{"id": "f831d872-5818-4b73-bf68-974ed8dd1551", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:156086", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Citizenship as a gift", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13621025.2018.1561827", "abstract": {"id": 165205670, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "While citizenship scholars have documented the increasing moralisation of immigration and integration policies, relatively few have explored how immigrants themselves make sense of their (partial) membership of European welfare states.

The innate immune system is activated by the interaction of pathogen-associated molecular patterns of microorganisms with Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of innate immunity via TLRs was shown to be a barrier to the induction of transplantation tolerance after lung transplantation. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in 10 genes coding for TLR1 to TLR1 0 might contribute to an altered immune response and the subsequent development of BOS. METHODS: DNA was collected from 110 lung transplant recipients. Twenty patients developed BOS. The control group comprised 422 individuals. Sixty-four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 genes coding for TLR10 to TLR10 were genotyped. RESULTS: The genotype distribution of TLR2 (rs1898830 and rs7656411), TLR4 (rs1927911) and TLR9 (rs352162 and rs187084) was significantly different between BOSpos patients and BOSneg patients and controls. The BOSpos group had significantly more patients with 3 or 4 of these risk alleles compared with the BOSneg and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 that recognize bacterial and viral pathogens are associated with BOS after lung transplantation.

This study explored health and nutritional status and their correlation with SCH in children attending primary school (3rd to 6th class) living in the area of Kasansa in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Methods: Across-sectional household survey was carried out in Kasansa health area in February 2011. Children whose parents reported to attend primary school (3rd to 6th class) were included. Socio-demographic characteristics, information on morbidity history and risk factor were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire. S. mansoni and malaria infection were assessed using the Kato-katz technique and rapid diagnostic test, respectively. Haemoglobin concentration was also performed using a portable HemoControl device. Bivariate and multiple logistic regressions were used to assess risk factors for S. mansoni. Results: A total of 197 school aged children participated in the study with a median age of 12 years and 53.8% of them were boys. The overall health status of the children was poor with very high prevalences of S. mansoni infection (89.3%), malaria infection (65.1%), anaemia (61.4%) and stunting (61.0%). Regular contact with river water was the most important risk factor (OR: 11.7; p&amp;lt;0.001) related to SCH infection. A low haemoglobin concentration was significantly associated with a SCH infection (OR: 12.3; p&amp;#61;0.003) and egg load was associated with stunting (OR: 12.4; p&amp;#61;0.04). Children from farmers were more at risk for low school performance (OR: 5.3; p&amp;#61;0.03). Conclusion: High prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni and malaria infection was observed in the study population living in Kasansa area.

This is a counterintuitive idea, as players of Tetris seem to be really manipulating the graphical shapes in this game. I will thus discuss two other possible descriptions of fictional actions hinted at by Grant Tavinor (2009). Firstly, the (non-)fictional status of videogame actions might depend on the nature of the affordances to which they are reactions. Secondly, it might be the case that the player must take on a role in the fictional world for her action to be fictional. In the end, I will combine this second idea with a Waltonian description of fictional actions to form a new description of fictional actions that corresponds to and explains videogame players experiences."}}{"id": "832c4386-83ed-4823-9332-f29983fa5f41", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:161778", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "In vitro and in vivo antiplasmodial activity of extracts and isolated constituents of Alstonia congensis root bark", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.02.019", "abstract": {"id": 312583193, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: An aqueous decoction of root bark of Alstonia congensis Engl.

Indeed, while specialization may improve foraging efficiency by a better knowledge of the spatio-temporal availability of resources, individuals may also become more vulnerable to fluctuations in these resources. In this study, we used multiyear GPS tracking data of 19 Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) breeding along the Belgian coast to assess whether foraging effort and reproductive success varied among different levels of foraging specialization. First, we quantified spatial and habitat specialization during incubation and chick rearing for 31 individual breeding cycles during which birds raised young until the age of 21 days. Next, we tested whether spatial and habitat specialization were related to the daily distance covered (as a proxy for foraging effort), and to chick growth (as a proxy for reproductive success). We found that birds primarily varied in their extent of habitat specialization. Habitat specialization was associated with reduced daily distances covered and increased offspring growth rates, in particular the growth rate of the youngest chicks. Yet, positive effects of habitat specialization on chick growth decreased at high levels of spatial specialization. Our results thus demonstrate fitness benefits of foraging specialization during our 5-year study period, but also highlight the need for longer-term studies as environmental changes may cause benefits to vary throughout a lifetime. GPS tracking reveals that specialization reduces foraging effort and increases the breeding success of Belgian Herring Gulls."}}{"id": "3825abaf-da99-40a9-97dc-02ddbe359bd2", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:161336", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Measurements of the Higgs boson width and anomalous HVV couplings from on-shell and off-shell production in the four-lepton final state", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevd.99.112003", "abstract": {"id": 312580667, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "Studies of on-shell and off-shell Higgs boson production in the four-lepton final state are presented, using data from the CMS experiment at the LHC that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 80.2 fb(-1) at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.

We identified three genome-wide significant FTLD-TDP risk loci: one new locus at chromosome 7q36 within the DPP6 gene led by rs118113626 (p value &amp;#61; 4.82e - 08, OR &amp;#61; 2.12), and two known loci: UNC13A, led by rs1297319 (p value &amp;#61; 1.27e - 08, OR &amp;#61; 1.50) and HLA-DQA2 led by rs17219281 (p value &amp;#61; 3.22e - 08, OR &amp;#61; 1.98). While HLA represents a locus previously implicated in clinical FTLD and related neurodegenerative disorders, the association signal in our study is independent from previously reported associations. Through inspection of our whole-genome sequence data for genes with an excess of rare loss-of-function variants in FTLD-TDP patients (n &amp;gt;&amp;#61; 3) as compared to controls (n &amp;#61; 0), we further discovered a possible role for genes functioning within the TBK1-related immune pathway (e.g., DHX58, TRIM21, IRF7) in the genetic etiology of FTLD-TDP. Together, our study based on the largest cohort of unrelated FTLD-TDP patients assembled to date provides a comprehensive view of the genetic landscape of FTLD-TDP, nominates novel FTLD-TDP risk loci, and strongly implicates the immune pathway in FTLD-TDP pathogenesis."}}{"id": "fdaecc6c-f954-4b92-bb66-69d64c8b6e32", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:90133", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Measurement of the lepton charge asymmetry in inclusive W production in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ &amp;#61; 7 TeV", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/jhep04(2011)050", "abstract": {"id": 309740103, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "A measurement of the lepton charge asymmetry in inclusive pp \u00e2\u2020\u2019 WX production at s&amp;#61;7TeV is presented based on data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 pb\u00e2\u02c6\u20191.

These intensities are quantitatively determined using model-based statistical parameter estimation theory. The distribution describing the probability that intensity values are generated by atomic columns containing a specific number of atoms is inferred on the basis of the experimental scattered intensities.

The number of atom columns available in the observed STEM image, the number of components in the estimated probability distribution, the width of the components of the probability distribution, and the typical shape of a criterion to assess the number of components in the probability distribution directly affect the accuracy and precision with which the number of atoms in a particular atom column can be estimated.

Patients and Methods: Between March 2003 and February 2007, 2 women and 3 men with an average age of 64 years were treated for an NTM infection of the hand and wrist. 4 patients had a tenosynovitis of the wrist. In I patient both wrists were involved. I patient had a granuloma of the index finger. The patients&amp;#39; charts, the operation reports, histological and bacteriological findings and the antibiogram were evaluated. Results: An inoculating trauma was identified in four patients. Intraoperatively rice bodies were present in the 4 patients with a tenosynovitis of the wrist. Histological findings showed acid-fast bacilli in 2 patients and chronic inflammatory reaction with/without granuloma (3/2) in 5 patients. Species identification was based on PCR and microbiological culture and revealed in three patients slow growing species (M. malmoense, M. nonchromogenicum, M. szulgai) and in two patients M. marinum (intermediate growth rate). Therapy consisted of immediate postoperative empirical combined drug treatment followed by antibiogram-based therapy. All patients showed healing of the infection at the final follow-up at an average of 25.2 months (range: 15-44 months) postoperatively. Conclusion: Consideration of non-tuberculous mycobacteria in the differential diagnosis in cases of localised tenosynovitis is paramount for diagnosis. Treatment based on graduated diagnostic steps, surgery and drugs (empirical followed by directed drugs) can achieve favourable clinical outcomes."}}{"id": "3f502547-de11-4ca6-a9cb-b13c5152b4c2", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:162703", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Bloodstream infections in south and southeast Asia", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(12)70297-9", "abstract": null}{"id": "d7a63154-2715-4153-9551-a1e0bae0d1e0", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:162690", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Melioidosis in the non-endemic setting", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2015.09.002", "abstract": null}{"id": "718986d6-4d6b-4291-b0ce-761aa5e761c4", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:162672", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Selective catalytic monoreduction of phthalimides and imidazolidine-2,4-diones", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201104226", "abstract": null}{"id": "64b109e4-a804-4f20-b1dc-f01b97a3caf9", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:162657", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Synthesis of cyclic carbonates from diols and $CO_{2}$ catalyzed by carbenes", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1039/c6cc05730f", "abstract": {"id": 307511027, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "The synthesis of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2 is a well-established reaction, whereas the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from diols and CO2 is considerably more challenging, and few efficient catalysts are available.

Whether this impaired chronotropic response reflects pathology of the sinoatrial node or is a consequence of altered cardiac hemodynamics is uncertain. We evaluated the adequacy of HR acceleration throughout exercise relative to metabolic demand and cardiac output in patients with a Fontan circulation relative to healthy controls. Methods and Results-Thirty subjects (20 healthy controls and 10 Fontan patients) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with simultaneous invasive pressure recording via a pulmonary and radial artery catheter during supine bicycle exercise to near maximal exertion. Adequacy of cardiac index, stroke volume, and HR reserve was assessed by determining the exercise-induced increase (Delta) in cardiac index, stroke volume, and HR relative to the increase in oxygen consumption (VO2). HR reserve was lower in Fontan patients compared with controls (71 &amp;#43;/- 21 versus 92 &amp;#43;/- 15 bpm; P&amp;#61;0.001). In contrast, increases in HR relative to workload and VO2 were higher than in controls. The change in cardiac index relative to the change in VO2 (Delta cardiac index/Delta VO2) was similar between groups, but Fontan patients had increased Delta HR/Delta VO2 and reduced A stroke volume/Delta VO2 compared with controls. There was an early and marked reduction in stroke volume during exercise in Fontan patients corresponding with a plateau in cardiac output at a low peak HR. Conclusions-In Fontan patients, the chronotropic response is appropriate relative to exercise intensity, implying normal sinoatrial function. However, premature reductions in ventricular filling and stroke volume cause an early plateau in cardiac output beyond which further increases in HR would be physiologically implausible. Thus, abnormal cardiac filling rather than sinoatrial node dysfunction explains the diminished HR reserve in Fontan patients."}}{"id": "d6b8ad11-24e3-466c-8806-2d3b8b8fc7af", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:162310", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Novel clinical associations with specific C9ORF72 transcripts in patients with repeat expansions in C9ORF72", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-015-1480-6", "abstract": {"id": 295054154, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "The loss of chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) expression, associated with C9ORF72 repeat expansions, has not been examined systematically.

HR23 proteins involved in proteasomal degradation and proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport were sequestered by poly(GA) in these mice. HR23A and HR23B similarly colocalized to poly(GA) inclusions in C9ORF72 expansion carriers. Sequestration was accompanied by an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and decreased xeroderma pigmentosum C (XPC) levels in mice, indicative of HR23A and HR23B dysfunction. Restoring HR23B levels attenuated poly(GA) aggregation and rescued poly(GA)-induced toxicity in neuronal cultures. These data demonstrate that sequestration and impairment of nuclear HR23 and nucleocytoplasmic transport proteins is an outcome of, and a contributor to, poly(GA) pathology."}}{"id": "f1900554-4412-4b78-bb57-49946b889090", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:162300", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Progranulin Deficiency Promotes Circuit-Specific Synaptic Pruning by Microglia via Complement Activation", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.04.001", "abstract": {"id": 295053878, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "Microglia maintain homeostasis in the brain, but whether aberrant microglial activation can cause neurodegeneration remains controversial. Here, we use transcriptome profiling to demonstrate that deficiency in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) gene progranulin (Grn) leads to an age-dependent, progressive upregulation of lysosomal and innate immunity genes, increased complement production, and enhanced synaptic pruning in microglia. During aging, Grn(-/-) mice show profound microglia infiltration and preferential elimination of inhibitory synapses in the ventral thalamus, which lead to hyperexcitability in the thalamocortical circuits and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-like grooming behaviors. Remarkably, deleting C1qa gene significantly reduces synaptic pruning by Grn(-/-) microglia and mitigates neurodegeneration, behavioral phenotypes, and premature mortality in Grn(-/-) mice. Together, our results uncover a previously unrecognized role of progranulin in suppressing aberrant microglia activation during aging. These results represent an important conceptual advance that complement activation and microglia-mediated synaptic pruning are major drivers, rather than consequences, of neurodegeneration caused by progranulin deficiency."}}
