Trust and discourse;Trust and Discourse: Organizational perspectives offers a timely collection of new articles on the relationship between discursive practices in organizational or institutional contexts and the psychological/moral category of trust. As globalization, the drive for efficiency and accountability, and increased time pressure lead groups and individuals to rethink the way they communicate, it is becoming more and more important to investigate how these streamlined and impersonal forms of communication affect issues of responsibility, authenticity and ultimately trust. The book deals with a variety of organizational settings ranging from in-hospital bedside teaching encounters and government communication following a nuclear accident to job interviews and foreign news reporting. This comprehensive study of an emerging new field will provide essential reading for linguists, discourse analysts, communication scholars, and other social scientists interested in a range of perspectives on oral, written and digital language use in society, including interactional sociolinguistics, Critical Discourse Analysis, ethnography, multimodality and organizational studies.;https://doi.org/10.1075/dapsac.56;yes;FAUX;
The challenge of measuring hunger through survey;There is widespread interest in estimating the number of hungry people in the world as well as trends in hunger. Current global counts rely on combining each countrys total food balance with information on distribution patterns from household consumption expenditure surveys. Recent research has advocated for calculating hunger numbers directly from these same surveys, which are increasingly available in low-income countries. For either approach, embedded in this effort are a number of important details about how household surveys are designed and how these data are then used. Using a survey experiment in Tanzania, this study finds great fragility in hunger counts stemming from alternative survey designs. As such, caution should be taken in drawing inferences on hunger over time and space based on household surveys.;https://doi.org/10.1086/686669;yes;FAUX;
Finite difference approximation of hedging quantities in the Heston model;"This note concerns the hedging quantities Delta and Gamma in the Heston model for European-style financial options.

Mind-sets of boundaryless careers in the public sector;Public management reforms have promoted a new type of public career: boundaryless employees following lateral career trajectories in different organizations. The literature opposes boundaryless careers to the traditional career for life, based on vertical trajectories of promotion and tenure. The implicit image of the boundaryless careerist is one of fast-moving, intrinsically motivated professionals who self-direct their career across old organizational barriers. In this article, we study whether boundaryless career mind-sets are the vanguard of a more flexible and mobile workforce. We describe how many public employees experience boundaryless career mind-sets, and we analyze what drives them. Our research shows that boundaryless mind-sets are still rather exceptional. The traditional career mind-set within the organization prevails and many employees are very satisfied with it. Only public employees who are highly educated, invest in their own career and networks, and were successful in previous mobility experiences report a boundaryless career mind-set. Nevertheless, our research also points to a higher potential for boundaryless career mind-sets.;https://doi.org/10.1177/0091026014528479;yes;FAUX;
Assessing indicators of currency crisis in Ethiopia;Currency crises, generally defined as rapid depreciations of a local currency or loss of foreign exchange reserves, are common incidents in modern monetary systems. Due to their repeated occurrence and severity, they have earned wide coverage by both theoretical and empirical literature. However, unlike advanced and emerging economies, currency crises in low-income countries have not received due attention. This paper uses the signals approach developed by Kaminsky et al. (1998) and assesses currency crisis in Ethiopia over the time frame January 1970 to December 2008. Using the Exchange Market Pressure Index (EMPI), we identify three currency crisis episodes that coincide with the liberalization following the fall of Ethiopian socialism, the Ethio-Eritrean border conflict, and the zenith of the global financial crisis. The timing shows the importance of both local and international dynamics. More macroeconomic indicators picked up the first crisis in a 24-month signalling window, compared to the latter two. Three categories of indicators were used: current account, capital account and domestic financial sector. None of the capital account indicators were significant based on the noise-to-signal ratio rule. One possible explanation for this might be the weak integration of the Ethiopian economy with global capital markets.;https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8268.12148;yes;FAUX;
QoE-driven rate adaptation heuristic for fair Adaptive Video Streaming;HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) is quickly becoming the de facto standard for video streaming services. In HAS, each video is temporally segmented and stored in different quality levels. Rate adaptation heuristics, deployed at the video player, allow the most appropriate level to be dynamically requested, based on the current network conditions. It has been shown that todays heuristics underperform when multiple clients consume video at the same time, due to fairness issues among clients. Concretely, this means that different clients negatively influence each other as they compete for shared network resources. In this article, we propose a novel rate adaptation algorithm called FINEAS (Fair In-Network Enhanced Adaptive Streaming), capable of increasing clients Quality of Experience (QoE) and achieving fairness in a multiclient setting. A key element of this approach is an in-network system of coordination proxies in charge of facilitating fair resource sharing among clients. The strength of this approach is threefold. First, fairness is achieved without explicit communication among clients and thus no significant overhead is introduced into the network. Second, the system of coordination proxies is transparent to the clients, that is, the clients do not need to be aware of its presence. Third, the HAS principle is maintained, as the in-network components only provide the clients with new information and suggestions, while the rate adaptation decision remains the sole responsibility of the clients themselves. We evaluate this novel approach through simulations, under highly variable bandwidth conditions and in several multiclient scenarios. We show how the proposed approach can improve fairness up to 80% compared to state-of-the-art HAS heuristics in a scenario with three networks, each containing 30 clients streaming video at the same time.;https://doi.org/10.1145/2818361;yes;FAUX;
Diaspora organizations, imagined communities and the versatility of diaspora;This article takes the case of Former Yugoslav organizations in the Netherlands to investigate how diaspora organizations are central in constructing identities. Contributing to the growing field of studies about Former Yugoslav diasporas, it explores how diaspora organizations play a role as cultural mediators. Drawing from theories of diaspora, imagined communities and transnationalism, we employ diaspora as a versatile tool of analysis, investigating dimensions of diasporic experience, discourse and practice. Data were gathered through a qualitative study including 25 expert interviews and ethnographic observations. The study indicates that there are two types of diaspora organizations, which are labelled exclusive and mixed diaspora organizations, and that there are notable differences between Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian organizations. Organizations are discussed with regard to their aims, activities and discourses about diaspora and their capacity to forge belongings among communities.;https://doi.org/10.1177/1367549414557803;yes;FAUX;
Sexual harassment;Sexual harassment in the workplace is commonly portrayed as the male supervisor harassing female subordinates. Within this popular characterization, the unequal distribution of formal, organizational power is believed to be a necessary precondition for sexual harassment. The traditional cultural image of harassers and targets has however not kept pace with changing workplace realities. Research has indeed found that female supervisors may in fact be more likely to be subjects of sexual harassment. This article uses survey data from the Australian Public Service to explore this kind of contrapower harassment. Results indicate that a strong link between gender, workplace authority, and sexual harassment exists, but also that this relationship is strongly influenced by age.;https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8500.12206;yes;FAUX;
Hybridity and the news;This paper introduces the Special Issues central theme of hybridity and the news, defining the scope and setting the scene for the multiple issues and debates covered by the individual contributions in this collection. Opposing both relativist positions that discard hybridity as an analytically useless concept, and preconceived notions that construe hybridity as intrinsically negative or positive, it is argued to move beyond binary thinking and to approach hybridity as a particularly rich site for the analysis of forms and processes of experimentation, innovation, deviation and transition in contemporary journalism. In order to profoundly understand these developments, which come in many forms, manifest themselves on different levels, and serve multiple purposes, a comprehensive, multi- and interdisciplinary perspective is needed. The Special Issue aims to contribute to this research agenda by looking closely into blending categories and interaction patterns in journalistic forms, genres, and practices, encompassing theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches from various disciplinary backgrounds including political and communication sciences, sociology, linguistics, cultural studies, and history. While taking different angles on the subject and being variously located on the macro and micro levels of analysis, the articles assembled here all engage in a careful assessment of hybridity and the news through profound conceptualizations and empirical analyses, connecting with and shedding new light on long-standing debates about the nature and meaning of journalism.;https://doi.org/10.1177/1464884916657520;yes;FAUX;
Japan and international refugee protection norms;Despite being a wealthy democracy and strong supporter of the international system, Japan has consistently recognized very few refugees. This article explores this conundrum. Specifically, it asks whether Japans low recognition rate signifies a lack of compliance with norms of international refugee protection and, after concluding in the affirmative, why this might be the case. The latter question is addressed systematically, using rationalist, normative and domestic institutional theories of international compliance. After proposing several potential factors, this article concludes by discussing how these factors can be addressed so as to promote a higher rate of Japanese refugee recognition.;https://doi.org/10.1177/0117196815606852;yes;FAUX;
The impact of multinational enterprises (MNEs) on knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) start-ups;"Jacobs W., van Rietbergen T., Atzema O., van Grunsven L. and van Dongen F. The impact of multinational enterprises (MNEs) on knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) start-ups: empirical evidence from the Dutch Randstad, Regional Studies. This paper focuses on the impact of multinational enterprises (MNEs) on the level of entrepreneurship in knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) in metropolitan regions. Large globalizing metropolitan regions or world cities&#39; are generally considered prime office locations for MNEs and KIBS alike. Certain locations in these metropolitan regions or world cities provide multifarious benefits of being co-agglomerated. Yet the impact of local MNEs, whether domestic or foreign, on successful local entrepreneurship in related KIBS has hardly been conceptually or empirically addressed in the literature. This paper presents evidence from the Dutch Randstad based on a questionnaire given to 2,000 KIBS firms founded in 2001-08 and supported by interviews with major international KIBS. The main conclusion is that MNEs in KIBS firms spawn successful entrepreneurship in KIBS. Implications for regional development policy are also addressed.

Current-induced birefringent absorption and non-reciprocal plasmons in graphene;We present extensive calculations of the optical and plasmonic properties of a graphene sheet carrying a dc current. By calculating analytically the densitydensity response function of current-carrying states at finite temperature, we demonstrate that an applied dc current modifies the Pauli blocking mechanism and that absorption acquires a birefringent character with respect to the angle between the in-plane light polarization and current flow. Employing random phase approximation at finite temperature, we show that graphene plasmons display a degree of non-reciprocity and collimation that can be tuned with the applied current. We discuss the possibility to measure these effects.;https://doi.org/10.1088/2053-1583/3/1/015011;yes;FAUX;
Real-time intraoperative optical coherence tomography imaging confirms older concepts about the Berger space;Background: The presence of a space between the posterior capsule and the anterior vitreous was first reported in 1887, but difficulties inherent in examining this structure made it impossible to visualize this area in vivo until now. Estimation of the size of this space was considered to be impossible. Materials and Methods: We utilized an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system attached to the Zeiss Opmi Lumera 700/Rescan microscope (Zeiss Ltd., Jena, Germany) to provide real-time images of the Berger space, the anterior hyaloid and the ligament of Wieger. Results: Imaging in 3 patients provided beautiful, real-time OCT images of the Berger space and of the ligament of Wieger. In one highly myopic eye, there was even evidence of anterior vitreous detachment. Conclusion: Previously unseen transparent structures of the eye can now be imaged intraoperatively using real-time OCT. This new technology seems very promising in achieving a better understanding of the anterior vitreous interface, more specifically of the anterior hyaloid and its posterior capsule attachment by the ligament of Wieger. Changes in the anterior hyaloid and its capsular attachment may contribute to a better understanding of the posterior segment complications after cataract surgery.;https://doi.org/10.1159/000446242;yes;FAUX;
Ab-initio study of the segregation and electronic properties of neutral and charged B and P dopants in Si and $Si/SiO_{2}$ nanowires;We perform first-principles calculations to investigate the preferred positions of B and P dopants, both neutral and in their preferred charge state, in Si and Si/SiO2 core-shell nanowires (NWs). In order to understand the observed trends in the formation energy, we isolate the different effects that determine these formation energies. By making the distinction between the unrelaxed and the relaxed formation energy, we separate the impact of the relaxation from that of the chemical environment. The unrelaxed formation energies are determined by three effects: (i) the effect of strain caused by size mismatch between the dopant and the host atoms, (ii) the local position of the band edges, and (iii) a screening effect. In the case of the SiNW (Si/SiO2 NW), these effects result in an increase of the formation energy away from the center (interface). The effect of relaxation depends on the relative size mismatch between the dopant and host atoms. A large size mismatch causes substantial relaxation that reduces the formation energy considerably, with the relaxation being more pronounced towards the edge of the wires. These effects explain the surface segregation of the B dopants in a SiNW, since the atomic relaxation induces a continuous drop of the formation energy towards the edge. However, for the P dopants, the formation energy starts to rise when moving from the center but drops to a minimum just next to the surface, indicating a different type of behavior. It also explains that the preferential location for B dopants in Si/SiO2 core-shell NWs is inside the oxide shell just next to the interface, whereas the P dopants prefer the positions next to the interface inside the Si core, which is in agreement with recent experiments. These preferred locations have an important impact on the electronic properties of these core-shell NWs. Our simulations indicate the possibility of hole gas formation when B segregates into the oxide shell.

Sharing the silver screen;"Despite the growing attention paid to the social practice of cinemagoing and to Indian diasporic film cultures, little research has combined these two topics. This article looks into issues of community as well as discursive practices occurring at the intersection of these two phenomena. First, it examines the physical community formation generated by the theater space as a setting for watching homeland films, in accordance with more general theories about diasporic communities and media consumption (Georgiou, 2006). Second, it looks into the audience discourses that precede and follow the actual cinemagoing act (Gillespie, 2002; Staiger, 2000). Based on a case study in the Belgian city of Antwerp, large-scale as well as in-depth insights are developed through a multi-method approach, combining analyses of in-depth interviews with the results of an exploratory cinema survey. These revealed that Indian diasporic cinemagoing is limited in its community-forming function (by issues of comfort, audience diversity, as well as behavioral conformism to a Western context) and is characterized by transnational discursive practices informing film preferences. A general change in the social experience of cinemagoing occurred in the diasporic context when compared to India and intercommunity differences found expression in cinemagoing culture.";https://doi.org/10.1177/0974927615586932;yes;VRAI;https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.3295432
"The influence of socio-economic status on mothers&#39; volubility and responsiveness in a monolingual Dutch-speaking sample";This article investigates the amount of input and the quality of motherchild interactions in mothers who differ in socio-economic status (SES): mid-to-high SES (mhSES) and low SES. The amount of input was measured as the number of utterances per hour, the total duration of speech per hour and the number of turns per hour. The quality of the motherchild interactions was analysed using a simple coding scheme: (1) response or not?, (2) incorporation or not? and (3) exact repetition or expansion? Main results showed that mothers of lowSES have fewer utterances per hour, shorter durations of speech and fewer turns per hour than mothers of mhSES. Also, lowSES mothers respond significantly less to their childrens utterances and use more exact repetitions than expansions.;https://doi.org/10.1177/0142723716639502;yes;FAUX;
Separation of modeling principles and design principles in enterprise engineering;An agile enterprise requires evolvable information systems and organizational structures. Some design theories, e.g. Normalized Systems theory, which were originally developed for designing information systems, have been generalized and extended for the design of organizations. In addition to information systems, Normalized Systems theory has recently expanded its applicability into the organizational level, including business process. This resulted in a set of 25 design guidelines for Normalized Systems Business Processes. On the other hand, Enterprise Ontology provides advantages in understanding the essence of organizations for massive abstraction and complexity reduction. Since these two streams of research apparently have similar goals, i.e. designing enterprises, using different approaches, some early studies tried to compare or combine them. However, most of them achieved limited success. This research investigates the literature, looking for a new way to connect them. It concludes that it may be possible to sequentially utilize those two artifacts in two different phases of enterprise engineering.;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-48393-1_28;yes;FAUX;
Practical tools for implementing early palliative care in advanced lung cancer;We read with interest the article by Blum and SchÃ¶nfeld [1]. Early introduction of palliative care (EPC) in the management of patients with advanced lung cancer is recommended because it improves quality of life and tends to produce better survival [2]. Hospital-based palliative teams mainly focus on terminal care for hospitalised patients. Involvement of the treating pulmonologist in this setting is warranted, as stated by Blum and SchÃ¶nfeld [1]. We would like to show you how we started EPC in collaboration with the palliative team in our hospital (table 1).;https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00382-2015;yes;FAUX;

Defining a standard set of patient-centred outcomes for lung cancer;In lung cancer, outcome measurement has been mostly limited to survival. Proper assessment of the value of lung cancer treatments, and the performance of institutions delivering care, requires more comprehensive measurement of standardised outcomes. The International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement convened an international, multidisciplinary working group of patient representatives, medical oncologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, pulmonologists, palliative care specialists, registry experts and specialist nurses to review existing data and practices. Using a modified Delphi method, the group developed a consensus recommendation (the set) on the outcomes most essential to track for patients with lung cancer, along with baseline demographic, clinical and tumour characteristics (case-mix variables) for risk adjustment. The set applies to patients diagnosed with nonsmall cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Our working group recommends the collection of the following outcomes: survival, complications during or within 6â€…months of treatment and patient-reported domains of health-related quality of life including pain, fatigue, cough and dyspnoea. Case-mix variables were defined to improve interpretation of comparisons. We defined an international consensus recommendation of the most important outcomes for lung cancer patients, along with relevant case-mix variables, and are working to support adoption and reporting of these measures globally.;https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.02049-2015;yes;VRAI;https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docman/irua/4f9cff/88899.pdf
The importance of realistic dispersal models in conservation planning;As biodiversity hotspots are often characterized by high human population densities, implementation of conservation management practices that focus only on the protection and enlargement of pristine habitats is potentially unrealistic. An alternative approach to curb species extinction risk involves improving connectivity among existing habitat patches. However, evaluation of spatially explicit management strategies is challenging, as predictive models must account for the process of dispersal, which is difficult in terms of both empirical data collection and modelling. Here, we use a novel, individual-based modelling platform that couples demographic and mechanistic dispersal models to evaluate the effectiveness of realistic management scenarios tailored to conserve forest birds in a highly fragmented biodiversity hotspot. Scenario performance is evaluated based on the spatial population dynamics of a well-studied forest bird species. The largest population increase was predicted to occur under scenarios increasing habitat area. However, the effectiveness was sensitive to spatial planning. Compared to adding one large patch to the habitat network, adding several small patches yielded mixed benefits: although overall population sizes increased, specific newly created patches acted as dispersal sinks, which compromised population persistence in some existing patches. Increasing matrix connectivity by the creation of stepping stones is likely to result in enhanced dispersal success and occupancy of smaller patches. Synthesis and applications. We show that the effectiveness of spatial management is strongly driven by patterns of individual dispersal across landscapes. For species conservation planning, we advocate the use of models that incorporate adequate realism in demography and, particularly, in dispersal behaviours.;https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.12643;yes;FAUX;
Regioselective versatility of monooxygenase reactions catalyzed by CYP2B6 and CYP3A4;"Hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes have broad and overlapping substrate specificity and catalyze a variety of monooxygenase reactions, including aliphatic and aromatic hydroxylations, N-hydroxylations, oxygenations of heteroatoms (N, S, P and I), alkene and arene epoxidations, dehalogenations, dehydrogenations and N-, O- and S-dealkylations. Individual CYP enzymes typically catalyze the oxidative metabolism of a common substrate in a regioselective and stereoselective manner. In addition, different CYP enzymes often utilize different monooxygenase reactions when oxidizing a common substrate. This review examines various oxidative reactions catalyzed by a CYP enzyme acting on a single substrate. In the first example, 2,2&#39;,4,4&#39;-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), a halogenated aromatic environmental contaminant, was oxidatively biotransformed by human CYP2B6. Nine different metabolites of BDE-47 were produced by CYP2B6 via monooxygenase reactions that included aromatic hydroxylation, with and without an NIH-shift, dealkylation and debromination. In the second example, lithocholic acid (3a-hydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid), an endogenous bile acid, served as a substrate for human CYP3A4 and yielded five different metabolites via aliphatic hydroxylation and dehydrogenation reactions.";https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-16009-2_5;yes;VRAI;https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docman/irua/f8cd2e/105242.pdf
Fast bias field reduction by localized Lloyd-Max quantization;Bias field reduction is a common problem in medical imaging. A bias field usually manifests itself as a smooth intensity variation across the image. The resulting image inhomogeneity is a severe problem for posterior image processing and analysis techniques such as registration or segmentation. In this paper, we present a fast debiasing technique based on localized Lloyd-Max quantization. Thereby, the local bias is modelled as a multiplicative field and is assumed to be slowly varying. The method is based on the assumption that the local, undegraded histogram is characterized by a limited number of gray values. The goal is then to find the discrete intensity values such that spreading those values according to the local bias field reproduces the global histogram as good as possible. We show that our method is capable of efficiently reducing (even strong) bias fields in 3D volumes in only a few seconds.;https://doi.org/10.1117/12.770724;yes;VRAI;https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docman/irua/753b8e/128729.pdf
LÃ¶wdin correlation energy density of the inhomogeneous electron liquid in some closed-shell molecules at equilibrium geometry;"Using existing theoretical studies, we point out that the dominant variable in determining Lwdin correlation energies per electron Ec/N of isoelectronic series of molecules at equilibrium is the total number of electrons. This turns out to be Ec/N &#61; -0.033 Â± 0.003 a.u. for CH4, NH3, H2O and HF (N &#61; 10), and Ec/N &#61; -0.039 Â± 0.007 for some 20 Si-containing molecules in the series SiXnYm. Following earlier work of March and Wind on atoms, some proposals are then made as to a possible explanation of such behaviour. A test is proposed, via low-order Mller-Plesset perturbation theory, as to whether the Lwdin correlation energy density Ã¥c(r) is, albeit approximately, a local functional Ã¥c(Ã±) of the ground-state density for molecules at equilibrium. Such an LDA assumption would imply that Ã¥c(Ã±) is quantitatively linear in Ã±(r), for closed-shell molecules at equilibrium, at least for the light atomic components treated here. This, in turn implies that the dominant effect of the Lwdin correlation energy for closed-shell molecules at equilibrium is merely to shift the chemical potential.";https://doi.org/10.1080/00319100701790069;yes;FAUX;
Globalization and variants of local adaptation;An increasing body of evidence indicates that globalization can trigger a variety of reactions from societies. The possible outcomes include blending, hybridization, fault line formation or even an increased salience of local traditionalist value systems. An important task for the research field is developing systematic, comparative theories predicting which outcome is expected to emerge depending on the interplay between the global and the local. Drawing on the rich empirical literature on globalization variants, the article takes a further step in theory building by proposing a typology with the four possible outcomes mentioned above. To make the model premises more transparent, the authors transcribe their arguments into symbolic logic sentences and derive the typology outcomes as theorems.

Here, we take the united atom Ne of CH4 as our focal point, and exploit the fact that the exchange-correlation potential Vxc(r) is known from the work of Zhao et al. (Q. Zhao, R.C. Morrison and R.G. Parr, Phys. Rev. A50, 2138 (1994)). Thus, we can calculate the explicit and sizeable contribution that the exchange-correlation force -ÃVxc/Ãr derived from this exchange-correlation potential makes to the measured X-ray scattering factor of Ne.;https://doi.org/10.1080/00319100802239479;yes;FAUX;
Seeing through the window: pre-fetching strategies for out-of-core image processing algorithms;Scientific data files have been increasing in size during the past decades. In the medical field, for instance. magnetic resonance imaging and computer aided tomography can yield image volumes of several gigabytes. While secondary storage (hard disks) increases in capacity and its cost per megabyte slumps over the years, primary memory (RAM) can still be a bottleneck in the processing of huge amounts of data. This represents a problem for image processing algorithms, which often need to keep in memory the original image and a copy of it to store the results. Operating systems optimize memory usage with memory paging and enhanced I/O operations. Although image processing algorithms usually work on neighbouring areas of a pixel, they follow pre-determined paths through the image and might not benefit from the memory paging strategies offered by the operating system, which are general purpose and unidimensional. Having the principles of locality and predetermined traversal paths in mind, we developed an algorithm that uses multi-threaded pre-fetching of data to build a disk cache in memory. Using the concept of a window that slides over the data, we predict the next block of memory to be read according to the path followed by the algorithm and asynchronously pre-fetch such block before it is actually requested. While other out-of-core techniques reorganize the original file in order to optimize reading, we work directly on the original file. We demonstrate our approach in different applications, each with its own traversal strategy and sliding window structure.;https://doi.org/10.1117/12.769423;yes;FAUX;
Flexible network reconstruction from relational databases with Cytoscape and CytoSQL;"Background Molecular interaction networks can be efficiently studied using network visualization software such as Cytoscape. The relevant nodes, edges and their attributes can be imported in Cytoscape in various file formats, or directly from external databases through specialized third party plugins. However, molecular data are often stored in relational databases with their own specific structure, for which dedicated plugins do not exist. Therefore, a more generic solution is presented. Results A new Cytoscape plugin &#39;CytoSQL&#39; is developed to connect Cytoscape to any relational database. It allows to launch SQL (&#39;Structured Query Language&#39;) queries from within Cytoscape, with the option to inject node or edge features of an existing network as SQL arguments, and to convert the retrieved data to Cytoscape network components. Supported by a set of case studies we demonstrate the flexibility and the power of the CytoSQL plugin in converting specific data subsets into meaningful network representations. Conclusions CytoSQL offers a unified approach to let Cytoscape interact with relational databases. Thanks to the power of the SQL syntax, this tool can rapidly generate and enrich networks according to very complex criteria. The plugin is available at http://www.ptools.ua.ac.be/CytoSQL.";https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-360;yes;FAUX;

Flexible estimation of serial correlation in nonlinear mixed models;In the conventional linear mixed-effects model, four structures can be distinguished: fixed effects, random effects, measurement error and serial correlation. The latter captures the phenomenon that the correlation structure within a subject depends on the time lag between two measurements. While the general linear mixed model is rather flexible, the need has arisen to further increase flexibility. In addition to work done in the area, we propose the use of spline-based modeling of the serial correlation function, so as to allow for additional flexibility. This approach is applied to data from a pre-clinical experiment in dementia which studied the eating and drinking behavior in mice.;https://doi.org/10.1080/02664760902914425;yes;VRAI;https://documentserver.uhasselt.be//bitstream/1942/11050/1/serial15%5b1%5d.pdf
Modified atomic scattering amplitudes and size effects on the 002 and 220 electron structure factors of multiple $Ga_{1-x}In_{x}As/GaAs$ quantum wells;"The modified atomic scattering amplitudes (MASAs) of mixed Ga<sub>1-x</sub>In<sub>x</sub>As, GaAs<sub>1-x</sub>N<sub>x</sub>, and InAs<sub>1-x</sub>N<sub>x</sub> are calculated using the density functional theory approach and the results are compared with those of the binary counterparts. The MASAs of N, Ga, As, and In for various scattering vectors in various chemical environments and in the zinc-blende structure are compared with the frequently used Doyle and Turner values. Deviation from the Doyle and Turner results is found for small scattering vectors (s&lt;0.3 Ã…<sup>-1</sup>) and for these scattering vectors the MASAs are found to be sensitive to the orientation of the scattering vector and on the chemical environment. The chemical environment sensitive MASAs are used within zero pressure classical Metropolis Monte Carlo, finite temperature calculations to investigate the effect of well size on the electron 002 and 220 structure factors (SFs). The implications of the use of the 002 (200) spot for the quantification of nanostructured Ga<sub>1-x</sub>In<sub>x</sub>As systems are examined while the 220 SF across the well is evaluated and is found to be very sensitive to the in-plane static displacements.";https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3115407;yes;FAUX;

Oral health screening;"Background The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and reliability of the Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT) as used by speech pathologists, to become part of a comprehensive clinical swallowing examination. Methods A multicentre study in 132 elderly subjects was conducted by speech pathologists. The inter-rater, testretest and intra-rater reliabilities of the OHAT were assessed in R statistics, version 3.0.1. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used for the total OHAT, and Kappa statistics were used for the individual categories. Results Total OHAT scores showed good inter-rater (ICC &#61; 0.96), intra-rater (ICC â‰¥ 0.95) and testretest (ICC â‰¥ 0.78) agreement. The inter-rater Kappa statistics were almost perfect (Îº â‰¥ 0.83) for seven of the eight individual categories of the OHAT and perfect for dental pain (Îº &#61; 1.00). The testretest Kappa statistics indicated excellent agreement for natural teeth and dentures (Îº â‰¥ 0.86). The intra-rater per cent agreement was excellent for all categories except gums and tissues. Conclusions This is the first study to examine the feasibility and reliability of the OHAT as used by speech pathologists. As the results showed both good feasibility and reliability, the OHAT has the potential to add to the clinical swallowing examination. However, future research investigating actual referral strategies and adaptation of care strategies following assessment with OHAT is needed.";https://doi.org/10.1111/idj.12220;yes;FAUX;

Melamineformaldehyde microcapsules;A systematic study has been carried out to compare the surface morphology, shell thickness, mechanical properties, and binding behavior of melamineformaldehyde microcapsules of 530 Î¼m diameter size with various amounts of core content by using scanning and transmission electron microscopy including electron tomography, in situ nanomechanical tensile testing, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. It is found that porosities are present on the outside surface of the capsule shell, but not on the inner surface of the shell. Nanomechanical tensile tests on the capsule shells reveal that Youngs modulus of the shell material is higher than that of bulk melamineformaldehyde and that the shells exhibit a larger fracture strain compared with the bulk. Core-loss elemental analysis of microcapsules embedded in epoxy indicates that during the curing process, the microcapsule-matrix interface remains uniform and the epoxy matrix penetrates into the surface micro-porosities of the capsule shells.;https://doi.org/10.1017/s1431927616012484;yes;FAUX;
Oscillatory persistent currents in quantum rings: semiconductors versus superconductors;Persistent currents are a hallmark of superconductivity in metals. To observe those dissipationless currents in a non-superconducting ring, the circumference of the ring must be short enough so that the phase coherence of the electronic wave functions is preserved around the loop. Recent progress in the fabrication of self-assembled semiconductor quantum rings (SAQRs), which can be filled with only a few (12) electrons, has offered the unique possibility to study the magnetic-field-induced oscillations in the persistent current carried by a single electron. In this paper, we discuss similarities and distinctions between the behavior of persistent currents in semiconductor and superconductor samples and give an overview of the recent results for oscillatory persistent currents in SAQRs. Although the real SAQR shape differs strongly from an idealized circular-symmetric open ring structure, the AharonovBohm oscillations of the magnetization survive, as observed in low temperature magnetization measurements on InxGa1âˆ’xAs/GaAs SAQRs.;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physc.2010.02.036;yes;FAUX;
The endovascular treatment of epistaxis;Epistaxis or nosebleed is relatively common in the general population. Depending on the location of the bleeding in the nasal cavity, epistaxis can be divided in two types: anterior or posterior type. The anterior type is far more frequent, often self-limiting and, if needed, is relatively easy treatable. Posterior type epistaxis is rare and more likely to require medical attention. The cornerstone of the conservative therapy of posterior epistaxis is nasal packing. Only in patients with persistent or recurrent epistaxis, endovascular intervention or surgery is indicated. Both treatment options have a similar success and complication rate, but endovascular treatment, if feasible, has several advantages above surgical treatment. The choice of procedure should be made on a patient-to-patient basis, taking several parameters into account. In this pictorial essay we present an overview of the relevant radiological anatomy and a review of various causes of epistaxis, with the emphasis on the endovascular treatment.;https://doi.org/10.5334/jbr-btr.954;yes;FAUX;
"Negative magnetoresistance in a $V^{3&#43;}/V^{4&#43;}$ mixed valent vanadate";The magnetotransport and magnetic properties of the PbV6O11 vanadate, crystallizing in the P63mc space group, reveal the existence of a negative magnetoresistance related to its ferromagnetic state (TC âˆ¼ 90â€‚K). The maximum effect is observed at 20 K reaching âˆ’30% in 9 T. The structural study of this ceramic reveals a V/Pb ratio smaller than expected from the formula. This is explained by the presence of numerous stacking faults observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy. The existence of these planar defects acting as resistive barriers along the c axis could be responsible for tunneling magnetoresistance.;https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3446892;yes;FAUX;
Ballistic current in metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors: the role of device topology;In this study we investigate the effect of device topology on the ballistic current in n-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors. Comparison of the nanoscale planar and double-gate devices reveals that, down to a certain thickness of the double gate film, the ballistic current flowing in the double gate device is twice as large compared to its planar counterpart. On the other hand, further thinning of the film beyond this threshold is found to change noticeably the confinement and transport characteristics, which are strongly depending on the film material and the surface orientation. For double gate Ge and Si devices there exists a critical film thickness below which the transverse gate field is no longer effectively screened by the inversion layer electron gas and mutual inversion of the two gates is turned on. In the case of GaAs and other similar IIIV compounds, a decrease in the film thickness may drastically change the occupation of the L-valleys and therefore amend the transport properties. The simulation results show that, in both cases, the ballistic current and the transconductance are considerably enhanced.;https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3197635;yes;FAUX;
Revealing age-specific past and future unrelated costs of pneumococcal infections by flexible generalized estimating equations;We aimed to study the excess health-care expenditures for persons with a known positive isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The data set was compiled by linking the database of the largest Belgian Sickness Fund with data obtained from laboratories reporting pneumococcal isolates. We analyzed the age-specific per-patient cumulative costs over time, using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). The mean structure was described by fractional polynomials. The quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion was used to compare different correlation structures. We show for all age groups that the health-care costs incurred by diagnosed pneumococcal patients are significantly larger than those incurred by undiagnosed matched persons. This is not only the case at the time of diagnosis but also long before and after the time of diagnosis. These findings can be informative for the current debate on unrelated costs in health economic evaluation, and GEEs could be used to estimate these costs for other diseases. Finally, these results can be used to inform policy on the expected budget impact of preventing pneumococcal infections.;https://doi.org/10.1080/02664763.2010.515302;yes;VRAI;https://curis.ku.dk/ws/files/41824362/JDEff_2010_IE_and_CC.pdf
Impact evaluation and interventions to address climate change: a scoping study;"Substantial and increasing amounts of funding are available for countries to undertake climate change interventions. This article argues that to ensure effective allocation of these resources, the selection and design of climate change mitigation and adaptation interventions should be based on evidence of what works, what doesn&#39;t work, under what circumstances and at what cost. Currently the evidence base on the impact of climate change interventions is minimal and there is a need for wider application of rigorous impact evaluation (IE) in the field. Climate change interventions have much to learn from experiences in related fields, notably international development and conservation. The paper highlights some of the challenges faced when conducting IEs of climate change interventions and discusses how these can be tackled. Moreover, it discusses some of the key areas of mitigation and adaptation interventions and suggests how IEs could be implemented, using IEs from other policy fields as examples. It argues that despite the limited experience so far there are ample opportunities to conduct IE of climate change interventions. If calls for increasing financing of climate change mitigation and adaptation by hundreds of billions of dollars a year are to remain credible and gain support, evidence of the effectiveness of current spending is essentia";https://doi.org/10.1080/19439341003786729;yes;VRAI;https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00719070/file/PEER_stage2_10.1080%252F19440049.2011.584069.pdf
Angular confinement and direction-dependent transmission in graphene nanostructures with magnetic barriers;We evaluate the transmission through magnetic barriers in graphene-based nanostructures. Several particular cases are considered: a magnetic step, single and double barriers, delta -function barriers as well as barrier structures with inhomogeneous magnetic field profiles but with average magnetic field equal to zero. The transmission exhibits a strong dependence on the direction of the incident wave vector. In general the resonant structure of the transmission is significantly more pronounced for (Dirac) electrons with linear spectrum compared to that for electrons with a parabolic one.;https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3295453;yes;VRAI;http://feb.kuleuven.be/drc/licos/publications/dp/DP%20365%20Complete.pdf
Phonon band structures of Si nanowires;We present full ab initio calculations of the phonon band structure of thin Si nanowires oriented along the [110] direction. Using these phonon dispersion relations we investigate the structural stability of these wires. We found that all studied wires were stable also when doped with either B or P, if the unit cell was taken sufficiently large along the wire axis. The evolution of the phonon dispersion relations and of the sound velocities with respect to the wire diameters is discussed.

The analysis shows that the industrial LNG, LPG, ammonia and petrochemical markets are slowly transforming to a competitive setting with an increasing number of private buyers and sellers rendering the market more efficient. The gas asset markets are still too small in size and illiquid so that entry and exit through the second-hand market remains difficult.;https://doi.org/10.1080/03081060.2010.527183;yes;FAUX;
A study of a positive fragment of path queries: expressiveness, normal form, and minimization;"We study the expressiveness of a positive fragment of path queries, denoted Path$\mathstrut&#43;$, on node-labeled trees documents. The expressiveness of Path$\mathstrut&#43;$ is studied from two angles. First, we establish that Path$\mathstrut&#43;$ is equivalent in expressive power to a particular sub-fragment as well as to the class of tree queries, a sub-class of the first-order conjunctive queries defined over label, parent-child, and child-parent predicates. The translation algorithm from tree queries to Path$\mathstrut&#43;$ yields a normal form for Path$\mathstrut&#43;$ queries. Using this normal form, we can decompose a Path$\mathstrut&#43;$ query into sub-queries that can be expressed in a very small sub-fragment of Path$\mathstrut&#43;$ for which efficient evaluation strategies are available. Second, we characterize the expressiveness of Path$\mathstrut&#43;$ in terms of its ability to resolve nodes in a document. This result is used to show that each tree query can be translated to a unique, equivalent, and minimal tree query. The combination of these results yields an effective strategy to evaluate a large class of path queries on documents.";https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-02843-4_14;yes;FAUX;
New challenges for urban social work and urban social work research;Most European cities have been, and still are, faced with a strong increase of inhabitants with other ethnic backgrounds. Globalization has increased the processes of migration during the last three decades, especially to urban areas. These processes are changing cities and their social landscape profoundly, not least because many migrants are being confronted with structural social exclusion. Consequently this evolution becomes one of the most important challenges for urban social work. One of the targets of social work research in an urban context in Europe is the need to interculturalize the way social work operates. In this article I explore how this increasing ethnic diversity is becoming one of the main challenges for urban social work. Specific methodologies are required to reach empowerment objectives with the diversity of citizens in urban contexts. Reflecting on a selection of cases, the article explores theoretical and methodological challenges for urban social work research.;https://doi.org/10.1080/13691457.2010.516621;yes;FAUX;
Evaluation as learning;The current contribution focuses on evaluation research as a process of learning and development for practice, by looking at conditions of collaboration between practice and research in two examples. We exemplify that learning from evaluation in complex programme settings is related to the nature of the collaboration between social work agencies and researchers. Findings are based on two similar cases of evaluation research for interagency collaboration in Germany and Slovenia. Results show that a symbiotic collaboration between research and practice enhances the learning and development potential for practice, but also that the balance between organizing the collaboration process and leaving room for experimental and ad hoc decisions needs to be guarded. Both advantages and disadvantages of planning and stability need to be taken into account when doing practitioner evaluation research.;https://doi.org/10.1080/13691457.2010.520411;yes;VRAI;https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/419133/file/448402.pdf
Modularity in enterprise architecture projects;Contemporary organizations are operating in increasingly volatile environments and must be able to respond quickly to changes in their environment. Enterprise Engineering aims to design agile organizations by applying theories from other elds. A theory from system sciences that receives much attention in this regard is modularity.

Our analysis shows that modularity can provide a relevant perspective in such projects. Moreover, it provides insights concerning the usage of enterprise architecture frameworks.

A maximum likelihood estimation method for denoising magnitude MRI using restricted local neighborhood;n this paper, we propose a method to denoise magnitude Magnetic Resonance (MR) images based on the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method using a restricted local neighborhood. Conventionally, methods that estimate the true, underlying signal from a local neighborhood assume this signal to be constant within that neighborhood. However, this assumption is not always valid and, as a result, the edges in the image will be blurred and fine structures will be destroyed. As a solution to this problem, we put forward the concept of using a restricted local neighborhood where the true intensity for each noisy pixel is estimated from a set of selected neighboring pixels. To this end, a reference image is created from the noisy image using a recently proposed non local means algorithm. This reference image is used as a prior for further noise reduction. A scheme is developed to locally select an appropriate subset of pixels from which the underlying signal is estimated. Experimental results based on Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Matrix (SSIM) and Bhattacharrya coefficient from synthetic and real MRI demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over other state of the art methods.;https://doi.org/10.1117/12.877850;yes;VRAI;https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/17887344/Fan_Geerts_ET_AL_2009_Discovering_Conditional_Functional_Dependencies.pdf
The labour market consequences of globalisation and regionalisation;Purpose This paper aims to introduce the subject of the impact of globalization and regionalization on the labour markets. The papers of the special issue are placed within this subject. Design/methodology/approach Although the subject is not treated exhaustively, the papers presented are new contributions dealing with labour market institutions, efficiency wages, employment effects of outward foreign direct investment, immigration patterns, and regional social and labour policies. These diverse issues are dealt with in their relation with increasing globalization in developed economies. Findings The major conclusions of the papers in the special issue are put into the perspective of the state of the art of the research on the social impact of globalization, particularly the labour market consequences. Originality/value A more comprehensive analysis of globalisation, which takes into account the complementarity of the different channels through which its effects on labour markets are transmitted, becomes more and more necessary.

Potential of an **in vitro** toolbox combined with exposure data as a first step for the risk assessment of dietary chemical contaminants;In vitro risk assessment of dietary contaminants has become a priority in human food safety. This paper proposes an in vitro approach associating different complementary tools in an original toolbox and aims to improve the assessment of the toxicological impact of dietary contaminants at realistic human exposure levels, with a special focus on the intestinal compartment. The system is based on the use of four complementary cellular tools, namely stress gene induction in transgenic strains of Escherichia coli, modulation of the activity of key biotransformation enzymes (cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 1A1 and 3A4) in a human intestinal cell line, and activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and oestrogenic receptor (ER)-dependent genes in agonistic and antagonistic assays with luciferase reporter cells. It was applied to four chosen model molecules: ochratoxin A (OTA) and deoxynivalenol (DON), two common food-borne mycotoxins, and imazalil (IMA) and benomyl (BEN), two fungicides widely occurring in foodstuffs. All these assays were performed at or around a realistic intestinal concentration, determined through a deterministic approach based on the calculation of a theoretical maximum daily intake (TMDI). Using the four model molecules, it is clearly highlighted that induction of CYP1A1 activity and inhibition of CYP3A4 activity occurred in Caco-2 cells at a realistic intestinal concentration of IMA. Furthermore, some bacterial stress genes were induced in a range of realistic concentrations, following exposure to DON and IMA. In addition, BEN clearly provoked an ER agonistic activity in a human oestrogen sensitive reporter cell line. All these results are in accordance with the literature, suggesting that the in vitro toolbox constitutes an interesting approach in order to obtain a first fingerprint of dietary contaminants at realistic human exposure for further risk assessment.;https://doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2011.584069;yes;VRAI;https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/1365-2664.12643
Participatory planning for project sustainability of environmental education projects;Within the first year of the Secondary Teacher Training Environmental Education Project (St2eep) in Zimbabwe, project stakeholders, including lecturers, college administrators, local project coordinators, and donor representatives, expressed concern about the nonâ€sustainability of the project due to its overâ€reliance on its international donor. In response to this challenge, a process of critical selfâ€reflection through selfâ€assessment workshops was started to give an opportunity for key project stakeholders to explore the challenge of project sustainability. Applying the principles of expansive learning theory to St2eeps reflection processes, this paper shows how the contradictions that emerge from the interaction between different project stakeholders can be powerful sources for learning. This has resulted in new forms of activity to address the challenge of project sustainability in St2eep.

This comparison provides deep insights into the nature of the signatures of the complicated IETS spectra and provides valuable structural information about the gate stack, such as the possible presence of oxygen vacancies in jet-vapour deposited HfO2. Important structural differences between the interface of atomic-layer or molecular-beam deposited HfO2 and the Si substrate are also revealed.;https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3644158;yes;FAUX;
Youth development and training after the Bosman Verdict (1995) and the Bernard Case (2010) of the European Court of Justice;"In this paper we propose a way out of the problem, created by the Bosman verdict, and the more recent Bernard case, of the European Court of Justice, which found itself caught between the European competition laws, on the one hand, and the need to develop and train young talent, on the other hand. The creation of a youth training fund, compensating clubs for their training costs in any case, that is: if the player moves to another team or stays with his training team.

Space charge limited electron emission from a Cu surface under ultrashort pulsed laser irradiation;In this theoretical study, the electron emission from a copper surface under ultrashort pulsed laser irradiation is investigated using a one dimensional particle in cell model. Thermionic emission as well as multi-photon photoelectron emission were taken into account. The emitted electrons create a negative space charge above the target, consequently the generated electric field reduces the electron emission by several orders of magnitude. The simulations indicate that the space charge effect should be considered when investigating electron emission related phenomena in materials under ultrashort pulsed laser irradiation of metals.the word abstract, but do replace the rest of this text.

Three-dimensional glenohumeral arthrokinematics related to internal impingement in throwing athletes;"The aim of this study was to undertake a comparative arthrokinematic evaluation of the shoulder of throwers with internal impingement. The participants were six throwing athletes with internal impingement type I. The intra-articular position of the humeral head on the glenoid in the apprehension test pose was evaluated using three-dimensional reconstructions obtained on medical images. Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit, external rotation gain, and the difference in posterior shoulder tightness were assessed goniometrically. No abnormal translation behaviour of the humeral head on the glenoid could be demonstrated, with a posterior positioning of the humeral head in relation to the centre of the glenoid of -6.6Â±0.9 mm and a superior positioning of &#43;2.3Â±1.5 mm, despite the presence of a glenohumeral internal rotation deficit between the throwing shoulder and the contralateral shoulder of -26.3Â±7.2Â° and a difference in posterior shoulder tightness of -6.7Â±2.9 cm. In conclusion, the results do not support the biomechanically based hypotheses relating internal impingement at the end of the late preparatory phase of throwing with an increased posterior-superior or anterior-inferior glenohumeral translation. Instead, the results favour a physiological cause of symptomatic internal impingement.";https://doi.org/10.1080/17461391003770509;yes;FAUX;
"Walter Benjamin&#39;s dialectics of attentiveness";"Walter Benjamin&#39;s literary, phenomenological, and analytical reflections on the concept of attentiveness reveal how distinctly his critical thinking was attuned to new forms of perception that arose from the cultural and aesthetic transformations taking place in the early twentieth century. Challenging existing distinctions between different modes of attentiveness-mainly absorption and concentration-he explores a radical form of attentiveness that enlists unexpected components, such as distraction or the power of habit. Tracing the development of a critical approach to the concept from the early to the late works, this article provides insights into Benjamin&#39;s alternative idea of attentiveness, one that emerges from a dialectics of opposites and is aligned with a &#39;physical presence of mind&#39; (&#39;leibhaftige Geistesgegenwart&#39;).";https://doi.org/10.1080/00397709.2011.552847;yes;VRAI;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1376916.1376949
Branch current behavior at two level anti-crossings in vertical quantum dot single-particle spectra;We study single-electron-elastic-resonant-tunneling through two weakly coupled vertical quantum dots and investigate the branch current behavior at anti-crossings between two single-particle energy levels in the constituent dot spectra that are induced to approach each other by application of an out-of-dot-plane magnetic field. We observe both the familiar case of monotonic transfer of the resonant current strengths between the two branches as well as the less familiar case of concurrent enhancement and suppression (ideally complete cancellation) of the resonant current in the two branches. These two situations can be explained in terms of a simple coherent tunneling model. Â©2009 American Institute of Physics;https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3295404;yes;FAUX;
Relative information completeness;"The paper investigates the question of whether a partially closed database has complete information to answer a query. In practice an enterprise often maintains master data Dm, a closed-world database. We say that a database D is partially closed if it satisfies a set V of containment constraints of the form &#34;q(D) is a subset of p(Dm)&#34;, where q is a query in a language Lc and p is a projection query. The part of D not constrained by (Dm,V) is open, from which some tuples may be missing. The database D is said to be complete for a query Q relative to (Dm,V) if for all partially closed extensions D&#39; of D, Q(D&#39;)&#61;Q(D), i.e., adding tuples to D either violates some constraints in V or does not change the answer to Q. We first show that the proposed model can also capture the consistency of data, in addition to its relative completeness. Indeed, integrity constraints studied for consistency can be expressed as containment constraints. We then study two problems. One is to decide, given Dm, V, a query Q in a language Lq and a partially closed database D, whether D is complete for Q relative to (Dm,V). The other is to determine, given Dm, V and Q, whether there exists a partially closed database that is complete for Q relative to (Dm,V). We establish matching lower and upper bounds on these problems for a variety of languages Lq and Lc. We also provide characterizations for a database to be relatively complete, and for a query to allow a relatively complete database, when Lq and Lc are conjunctive queries.";https://doi.org/10.1145/1559795.1559811;yes;VRAI;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1559795.1559811
Algebraic structures for capturing the provenance of SPARQL queries;We show that the evaluation of SPARQL algebra queries on various notions of annotated RDF graphs can be seen as particular cases of the evaluation of these queries on RDF graphs annotated with elements of so-called spm-semirings. Spm-semirings extend semirings, used for positive relational algebra queries on annotated relational data, with a new operator to capture the semantics of the non-monotone SPARQL operator OPTIONAL. Furthermore, spm-semiring-based annotations ensure that desired SPARQL query equivalences hold when querying annotated RDF. In addition to introducing spm-semirings, we study their properties and provide an alternative characterization of these structures in terms of semirings with an embedded boolean algebra (or seba-structure for short). This characterization allows to construct spm-semirings and to identify a universal object in the class of spm-semirings. Finally, we show that this universal object provides a concise provenance representation and can be used to evaluate SPARQL queries on arbitrary spm-semiring-annotated RDF graphs.;https://doi.org/10.1145/2448496.2448516;yes;FAUX;
On the influence of maintenance activity types on the issue resolution time;"The ISO/IEC 14764 standard specifies four types of software maintenance activities spanning the different motivations that software engineers have while performing changes to an existing software system. Undoubtedly, this classification has helped in organizing the workflow within software projects, however for planning purposes the relative time differences for the respective tasks remains largely unexplored. In this empirical study, we investigate the influence of the maintenance type on issue resolution time. From GitHub&#39;s issue repository, we analyze more than 14000 issue reports taken from 34 open source projects and classify them as corrective, adaptive, perfective or preventive maintenance. Based on this data, we show that the issue resolution time depends on the maintenance type. Moreover, we propose a statistical model to describe the distribution of the issue resolution time for each type of maintenance activity. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of this model for scheduling the maintenance workload.";https://doi.org/10.1145/2639490.2639506;yes;VRAI;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2901737
Determining the currency of data;Data in real-life databases become obsolete rapidly. One often finds that multiple values of the same entity reside in a database. While all of these values were once correct, most of them may have become stale and inaccurate. Worse still, the values often do not carry reliable timestamps. With this comes the need for studying data currency, to identify the current value of an entity in a database and to answer queries with the current values, in the absence of timestamps. This paper investigates the currency of data. (1) We propose a model that specifies partial currency orders in terms of simple constraints. The model also allows us to express what values are copied from other data sources, bearing currency orders in those sources, in terms of copy functions defined on correlated attributes. (2) We study fundamental problems for data currency, to determine whether a specification is consistent, whether a value is more current than another, and whether a query answer is certain no matter how partial currency orders are completed. (3) Moreover, we identify several problems associated with copy functions, to decide whether a copy function imports sufficient current data to answer a query, whether such a function copies redundant data, whether a copy function can be extended to import necessary current data for a query while respecting the constraints, and whether it suffices to copy data of a bounded size. (4) We establish upper and lower bounds of these problems, all matching, for combined complexity and data complexity, and for a variety of query languages. We also identify special cases that warrant lower complexity.;https://doi.org/10.1145/1989284.1989295;yes;VRAI;https://documentserver.uhasselt.be//bitstream/1942/11703/1/p30-antonopoulos.pdf
Slidecast Yourself: Exploring the Possibilities of a New Online Presentation Tool;"Many educational theorists stress the importance of social aspects for effective learning. In &#34;communities of practice&#34; for instance, groups of practitioners might learn from each other and eventually constitute a shared identity. Web 2.0 provides an ideal opportunity for this. An example of such a Web 2.0 information technology is slidecasting, which can be described as podcasting by synchronizing PowerPoint and voice. Anyone can upload their slidecasts to a website with an interface similar to YouTube, and anybody can watch these products. However, there is limited research on this topic, its possible application in education, and its popularity in businesses. We therefore studied the educational implications of introducing slidecasting in the classroom, sent a survey to our students to detect their attitude towards this new teaching tool, and organised a focus group with communication professionals. We can conclude that slidecasting can be successful in education, but that it will not immediately gain access to the corporate world due to problems concerning confidentiality and the very nature of slidecasting.";https://doi.org/10.1109/ipcc.2010.5530021;yes;VRAI;https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/17895695/Fan_Geerts_ET_AL_2011_Determining_the_currency_of_data.pdf
Towards efficient service placement and server selection for large-scale deployments;Currently many service providers offer their services using a private and proprietary hard- and software infrastructure. These infrastructures often share many similarities. Hence we believe a generic service delivery architecture, that allows service providers to offer a large array of different services on a shared infrastructure, would provide many advantages over current silo-based approaches. In this paper we propose the first step towards such an architecture, namely several algorithms for dynamically allocating server and network resources to a set of services and selecting a suitable service instance for each client. Service instances are placed on a set of servers, taking into account network resources (available bandwidth), server resources (CPU and memory) and service quality of service (QoS) demands (maximum transmission delay and bandwidth requirements). The optimization goal is to maximize the percentage of satisfied demand (answered requests) and minimize the total number of used servers for service hosting. Each service has a relative priority, which can be manually adjusted to influence the placement scheme.;https://doi.org/10.1109/aict.2008.46;yes;VRAI;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2213556.2213592
Unifying nearest neighbors collaborative filtering;We study collaborative filtering for applications in which there exists for every user a set of items about which the user has given binary, positive-only feedback (one-class collaborative filtering). Take for example an on-line store that knows all past purchases of every customer. An important class of algorithms for one-class collaborative filtering are the nearest neighbors algorithms, typically divided into user-based and item-based algorithms. We introduce a reformulation that unifies user- and item-based nearest neighbors algorithms and use this reformulation to propose a novel algorithm that incorporates the best of both worlds and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, we propose a method for naturally explaining the recommendations made by our algorithm and show that this method is also applicable to existing user-based nearest neighbors methods.;https://doi.org/10.1145/2645710.2645731;yes;VRAI;https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01411827/file/a7-geerts.pdf
Increasing the expressivity of conditional functional dependencies without extra complexity;The paper proposes an extension of CFDs [1], referred to as extended Conditional Functional Dependencies (eCFDs). In contrast to CFDs, eCFDs specify patterns of semantically related values in terms of disjunction and inequality, and are capable of catching inconsistencies that arise in practice but cannot be detected by CFDs. The increase in expressive power does not incur extra complexity: we show that the satisfiability and implication analyses of eCFDs remain NP - complete and coNP -complete, respectively, the same as their CFDs counterparts. In light of the intractability, we present an algorithm that approximates the maximum number of eCFDs that are satisfiable. In addition, we revise SQL techniques for detecting CFD violations, and show that violations of multiple eCFDs can be captured via a single pair of SQL queries. We also introduce an incremental SQL technique for detecting eCFD violations in response to database updates. We experimentally verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our SQL -based detection methods.;https://doi.org/10.1109/icde.2008.4497460;yes;VRAI;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2594538.2594551
Generating, sampling and counting subclasses of regular tree languages;To experimentally validate learning and approximation algorithms for XML Schema Definitions (XSDs), we need algorithms to generate uniformly at random a corpus of XSDs as well as a similarity measure to compare how close the generated XSD resembles the target schema. In this paper, we provide the formal foundation for such a testbed. We adopt similarity measures based on counting the number of common and different trees in the two languages, and we develop the necessary machinery for computing them. We use the formalism of extended DTDs (EDTDs) to represent the unranked regular tree languages. In particular, we obtain an efficient algorithm to count the number of trees up to a certain size in an unambiguous EDTD. The latter class of unambiguous EDTDs encompasses the more familiar classes of single-type, restrained competition and bottom-up deterministic EDTDs. The single-type EDTDs correspond precisely to the core of XML Schema, while the others are strictly more expressive. We also show how constraints on the shape of allowed trees can be incorporated. As we make use of a translation into a well-known formalism for combinatorial specifications, we get for free a sampling procedure to draw members of any unambiguous EDTD. When dropping the restriction to unambiguous EDTDs, i.e. taking the full class of EDTDs into account, we show that the counting problem becomes #P-complete and provide an approximation algorithm. Finally, we discuss uniform generation of single-type EDTDs, i.e., the formal abstraction of XSDs. To this end, we provide an algorithm to generate k-occurrence automata (k-OAs) uniformly at random and show how this leads to uniform generation of single-type EDTDs.;https://doi.org/10.1145/1938551.1938559;no;VRAI;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2594538.2594551
Static analysis of schema-mappings ensuring oblivious termination;A schema-mapping is a high level specification of a data-exchange setting where a set of source-to-target dependencies is used to realize basic operations from source to target relations (such as copy, selection, join or union) while the target schema is subject to a set of target constraints (such as inclusion dependencies or key constraints). In this paper, we consider strong schema-mappings that allow for additional constraints such as source dependencies on the source schema and target-to-source dependencies from the target relations back to the source. Furthermore, strong schema-mappings may include disjunctive dependencies. We argue that this extension is desirable when the source instance is to provide both a lower and upper bound on the information that a target instance can have. We first focus on the implication problem for strong schema-mappings which is to determine whether a given constraint Î´ is logically implied by the set Î£ of constraints (denoted by Ïƒ âŠ¨ Î´). After providing complete characterizations for this problem in terms of universal solutions (while supporting equality constraints), we introduce criteria of termination, denoted by TOC, DTOC and MTOC, that allow the efficient computation of universal solutions for standard constraints, disjunctive constraints, and when the source instance is assumed to be immutable (i.e., it is master data), respectively. We obtain decision procedures for the implication problem, provided that Î£ satisfies these termination conditions, and give the corresponding complexity bounds. As an immediate application we revisit the problems of determinacy, relative information completeness and variations thereof, all for strong schema-mappings. Indeed, by viewing them as implication problems we obtain efficient decision procedures when the relevant termination conditions are satisfied. We then focus on the problem of deciding whether source-to-target constraints in a strong schema-mapping are already implied by the embedded (standard) schema-mapping. This problem is important if one wants to use target-to-source constraints in standard data-exchange tools. Since no such constraints are logically implied by standard schema-mappings (and hence the results established earlier are of no use), we provide an alternative semantics for implication. More specifically, we want the constraint to be satisfied by every solution corresponding to the output of a standard data-exchange tool. We consider three semantics based on universal solutions, cores and CWA-solutions, respectively. Decidability of the implication of general (resp. safe) target-to-source constraints is shown for the CWA-based semantics (resp. core-semantics).;https://doi.org/10.1145/1804669.1804694;yes;FAUX;
Querying big data by accessing small data;This paper investigates the feasibility of querying big data by accessing a bounded amount of the data. We study boundedly evaluable queries under a form of access constraints, when their evaluation cost is determined by the queries and constraints only. While it is undecidable to determine whether FO queries are boundedly evaluable, we show that for several classes of FO queries, the bounded evaluability problem is decidable. We also provide characterization and effective syntax for their boundedly evaluable queries. When a query Q is not boundedly evaluable, we study two approaches to approximately answering Q under access constraints. (1) We search for upper and lower envelopes of Q that are boundedly evaluable and warrant a constant accuracy bound. (2) We instantiate a minimum set of variables (parameters) in Q such that the specialized query is boundedly evaluable. We study problems for deciding the existence of envelopes and bounded specialized queries, and establish their complexity for various classes of FO queries.;https://doi.org/10.1145/2745754.2745771;yes;FAUX;
On scale independence for querying big data;To make query answering feasible in big datasets, practitioners have been looking into the notion of scale independence of queries. Intuitively, such queries require only a relatively small subset of the data, whose size is determined by the query and access methods rather than the size of the dataset itself. This paper aims to formalize this notion and study its properties. We start by defining what it means to be scale-independent, and provide matching upper and lower bounds for checking scale independence, for queries in various languages, and for combined and data complexity. Since the complexity turns out to be rather high, and since scale-independent queries cannot be captured syntactically, we develop sufficient conditions for scale independence. We formulate them based on access schemas, which combine indexing and constraints together with bounds on the sizes of retrieved data sets. We then study two variations of scale-independent query answering, inspired by existing practical systems. One concerns incremental query answering: we check when query answers can be maintained in response to updates scale-independently. The other explores scale-independent query rewriting using views.;https://doi.org/10.1145/2594538.2594551;yes;VRAI;https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2745754.2745771
On the complexity of package recommendation problems;"Recommendation systems aim to recommend items that are likely to be of interest to users. This paper investigates several issues fundamental to such systems. We model recommendation systems for packages of items. We use queries to specify multi-criteria for item selections and express compatibility constraints on items in a package, and use functions to compute the cost and usefulness of items to a user. We study recommendations of points of interest, to suggest top-k packages. We also investigate recommendations of top-k items, as a special case. In addition, when sensible suggestions cannot be found, we propose query relaxation recommendations to help users revise their selection criteria, or adjustment recommendations to guide vendors to modify their item collections. We identify several problems, to decide whether a set of packages makes a top-k recommendation, whether a rating bound is maximum for selecting top-k packages, whether we can relax the selection query to find packages that users want, and whether we can update a bounded number of items such that the users&#39; requirements can be satisfied. We also study function problems for computing top-k packages, and counting problems to find how many packages meet the user&#39;s criteria. We establish the upper and lower bounds of these problems, all matching, for combined and data complexity. These results reveal the impact of variable sizes of packages, the presence of compatibility constraints, as well as a variety of query languages for specifying selection criteria and compatibility constraints, on the analyses of these problems.";https://doi.org/10.1145/2213556.2213592;yes;VRAI;https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7235200/file/7235208.pdf
Complexity and composition of synthesized web services;"The paper investigates fundamental decision problems and composition synthesis for Web services commonly found in practice. We propose a notion of synthesized Web services (ASTs) to specify the behaviors of the services. Upon receiving a sequence of input messages, an AST issues multiple queries to a database and generates actions, in parallel; it produces external messages and database updates by synthesizing the actions parallelly generated. In contrast to previous models for Web services, ASTs advocate parallel processing and (deterministic) synthesis of actions. We classify ASTs based on what queries an AST can issue, how the synthesis of actions is expressed, and whether unbounded input sequences are allowed in a single interaction session. We show that the behaviors of Web services supported by various prior models, data-driven or not, can be specified by different AST classes. For each of these classes we study the non-emptiness, validation and equivalence problems, and establish matching upper and lower bounds on these problems. We also provide complexity bounds on composition synthesis for these AST classes, identifying decidable cases.";https://doi.org/10.1145/1376916.1376949;yes;FAUX;
Corporate residence fraud detection;"With the globalisation of the world&#39;s economies and ever-evolving financial structures, fraud has become one of the main dissipaters of government wealth and perhaps even a major contributor in the slowing down of economies in general. Although corporate residence fraud is known to be a major factor, data availability and high sensitivity have caused this domain to be largely untouched by academia. The current Belgian government has pledged to tackle this issue at large by using a variety of in-house approaches and cooperations with institutions such as academia, the ultimate goal being a fair and efficient taxation system. This is the first data mining application specifically aimed at finding corporate residence fraud, where we show the predictive value of using both structured and fine-grained invoicing data. We further describe the problems involved in building such a fraud detection system, which are mainly data-related (e.g. data asymmetry, quality, volume, variety and velocity) and deployment-related (e.g. the need for explanations of the predictions made).";https://doi.org/10.1145/2623330.2623333acm;yes;FAUX;
Capturing missing tuples and missing values;Databases in real life are often neither entirely closed-world nor entirely open-world. Indeed, databases in an enterprise are typically partially closed, in which a part of the data is constrained by master data that contains complete information about the enterprise in certain aspects [21]. It has been shown that despite missing tuples, such a database may turn out to have complete information for answering a query [9]. This paper studies partially closed databases from which both tuples and values may be missing. We specify such a database in terms of conditional tables constrained by master data, referred to as c-instances. We first propose three models to characterize whether a c-instance T is complete for a query Q relative to master data. That is, depending on how missing values in T are instantiated, the answer to Q in T remains unchanged when new tuples are added. We then investigate four problems, to determine (a) whether a given c-instance is complete for a query Q, (b) whether there exists a c-instance that is complete for Q relative to master data available, (c) whether a c-instance is a minimal-size database that is complete for Q, and (d) whether there exists a c-instance of a bounded size that is complete for Q. We establish matching lower and upper bounds on these problems for queries expressed in a variety of languages, in each of the three models for specifying relative completeness.;https://doi.org/10.1145/1807085.1807109;yes;FAUX;
Discovering conditional functional dependencies;This paper investigates the discovery of conditional functional dependencies (CFDs). CFDs are a recent extension of functional dependencies (FDs) by supporting patterns of semantically related constants, and can be used as rules for cleaning relational data. However, finding CFDs is an expensive process that involves intensive manual effort. To effectively identify data cleaning rules, we develop techniques for discovering CFDs from sample relations. We provide three methods for CFD discovery. The first, referred to as CFDMiner, is based on techniques for mining closed itemsets, and is used to discover constant CFDs, namely, CFDs with constant patterns only. The other two algorithms are developed for discovering general CFDs. The first algorithm, referred to as CTANE, is a levelwise algorithm that extends TANE, a well-known algorithm for mining FDs. The other, referred to as FastCFD, is based on the depthfirst approach used in FastFD, a method for discovering FDs. It leverages closed-itemset mining to reduce search space. Our experimental results demonstrate the following. (a) CFDMiner can be multiple orders of magnitude faster than CTANE and FastCFD for constant CFD discovery. (b) CTANE works well when a given sample relation is large, but it does not scale well with the arity of the relation. (c) FastCFD is far more efficient than CTANE when the arity of the relation is large.;https://doi.org/10.1109/icde.2009.208;yes;FAUX;

Clinical oncology in resource-limited settings;"Infectious Agents and Cancer is introducing a new section of Clinical Oncology with the main objective of stimulating debate through articles published in the section. Infectious diseases have been the major causes of morbidity and mortality in human populations, and have dominated the medical approach to clinical and public health. Successful efforts to control mortality from acute infections have paved the way for chronic, mostly indolent, infections to become major causes of morbidity. Cancer, hitherto thought to be rare in resource-limited settings, is becoming a major contributor. The changes in mortality patterns are due, in part, to diseases linked to rapid changes in lifestyle, urbanization, and pollution. These diseases include many of the non-infection associated cancers. However, there is a dearth of information about the burden, pathogenesis, and therapeutic approaches about cancer in resource-limited countries. There are also substantial other challenges, including economic, infrastructure, technology, and personnel. The Journal advocates for interactive local-global (lo-bal) efforts to generate relevant knowledge about cancer burden, pathogenesis, and therapeutic approaches using a bottom-up approach to sharpen the focus on local and global relevance of research and clinical and public practice, particularly in resource-limited countries. The section on Clinical Oncology in Infectious Agents and Cancer will harness these &#34;lo-bal&#34; strategies to reduce substantially the time from concept, discovery, and development and implementation of locally and globally applicable diagnostic and therapeutic technologies.";https://doi.org/10.1186/1750-9378-8-39;yes;VRAI;https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docman/irua/e7eea4/139079.pdf

Dilemma in metastatic colorectal cancer;"The modern approach for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients is based on the identification of oncogenic pathways, which could be targeted by specific molecules. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)- and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)-related pathways represent the most important biological mechanisms for cancer development and progression. However, the most significant results by VEGF and EGFR targeting could be achieved through the combination of these drugs with standard chemotherapeutic regimens. These strategies aim to improve the resectability of liver and lung metastases. For those patients who cannot be eligible for metastases resection, a &#39;continuum of care&#39; has been proposed as the best option. This strategy includes the sequential delivery of various regimens with different targeted drugs. For this reason the choice of the pathway to target, that is, VEGF or EGFR, is not a real dilemma since both these molecules would be targeted during the mCRC natural history.

Should apple snail **Pomacea canaliculata** (Caenogastropoda, Ampullariidae) be used as bioindicator for BDE-209?;"Apple snail Pomacea canaliculata has been reported to accumulate polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and was recently proposed as PBDE bioindicator. This work investigates the ability of P. canaliculata to accumulate BDE-209 by dietary exposure under controlled experimental conditions. A 30-day long enrichment feeding assay was carried out using 30 adult apple snails, placed in individual aquaria. Food was enriched at three BDE-209 concentrations (400, 4,700, and 8,300 mu g g(-1) lipid weight). Correlation between BDE-209 values in food and snail tissue were estimated according to Stockholm Convention suggested criteria for chemicals with K-OW &gt; 5. All animals survived with no evident physical alterations, and all of them accumulated BDE-209. BDE-209 levels in tissue samples increased exponentially with the exposure concentration. The bioaccumulation factor vs. food concentration plot showed a peculiar pattern, in which at intermediate concentrations the snails accumulated less BDE-209 than expected. Our results suggest that P. canaliculata would present a detoxification mechanism for BDE-209 different from the most commonly reported metabolic pathways.";https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-2109-8;yes;FAUX;
Looking for a new panacea in ALK-rearranged NSCLC;In the past decade, the advent of targeted therapy led to a silent revolution in the war against lung cancer and a significant evolution on the concept of Phase I clinical trials design. Thanks to the specificity of their target, the new drugs have radically changed NSCLC treatment, leading to the development of personalized strategies. The accelerated approval of the first ALK-inhibitor, Crizotinib and more recently Ceritinib, without a Phase III randomized, clinical trial, has been an amazing success story in lung cancer research, marking the beginning of a new decade of targeted drugs development, characterized by modern, biomarker-driven, early clinical trial design and shorter times for clinical approval. Is Ceritinib a new panacea for the treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC? We aimed to discuss the reasons of such success, including the new emerging questions, regarding mechanisms of acquired resistance, and the best treatment algorithm for ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients.;https://doi.org/10.1517/14728222.2014.936383;yes;VRAI;https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docman/irua/96d67a/9118.pdf
Guest editorial;"Our original aspiration for this special issue was to attract a broad base of visual communication scholars working on the nexus of difference and globalization, with the aim of defining the substance and assessing the significance of this particular dialectic in our field. While globalization does entail the ever-growing significance of deterritorialized practices and transcultural flows, these connections, movements and exchanges still largely occur across specific locales and identities, and through appeals to various dimensions of cultural and social difference. Purposefully comprehensive in scope, our call for papers led to over 70 proposals that tackled the relationship between globalization and race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class and religion in visual communication from a number of theoretical angles, including but not limited to diasporic, queer, postcolonial, feminist and intercultural perspectives. Taken together, the seven contributions included in this special issue address questions related to the integration and deployment of major dimensions of social and cultural difference in visual communication materials; the perspectives and practices of designers, image-makers and media producers in relation to the work involved in the planning and creation of such materials; and both the dominant ways of seeing and unique experiences that impact on the visual reading of globalization. A combination of well-known and emerging scholars makes for an unusually energetic take on concepts and concerns that underlie several of the major frameworks that have become established in the inherently interdisciplinary field of visual communication, including multimodal and critical discourse analysis, social semiotics, rhetorical criticism, visual anthropology and visual sociology. As a whole, the special issue is based on three main assumptions regarding the centrality of visual communication, the significance of difference, and the ways in which identities are constructed and exchanged in settings of cultural globalization.";https://doi.org/10.1177/1470357214533448;yes;FAUX;
"How to find the Ariadne&#39;s thread in the labyrinth of salvage treatment options for metastatic colorectal cancer?";Since a chance for cure was found out in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients undergoing a resection of liver and lung metastases, high tumor shrinkage by chemotherapy regimens and their combination with targeted agents have been addressed in potentially resectable mCRC. However, most mCRC patients cannot reach this opportunity because of tumor burden or metastatic sites. For these patients a salvage systemic therapy could be offered to prolong survival. To date, a huge number of clinical trials provided some evidences for the achievement of this goal. A lot of chemotherapeutic regimens in combination with biological therapies are now available. We tried to propose a simple way to choose the best options and to plan an optimal sequence of treatments. This tool could help the oncologists worldwide to better and easily manage mCRC patients who need salvage systemic therapy.;https://doi.org/10.1517/14712598.2014.902926;yes;VRAI;http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/87637/3/Aiello%20Pauwels%20Difference%20and%20Globalization.pdf
Memories of cinemagoing and film experience;"Over the past two decades, the relationship between cinema and memory has been the object of increasing academic attention, with growing interest in film and cinema as repositories for representing, shaping, (re) creating or indexing forms of individual and collective memory. This Special Issue on memory and the experience of cinemagoing centres on the perspective of cinema users and audiences, focusing on memories of films, cinema and cinemagoing from three continents and over five decades of the twentieth century. This introduction considers the relationship between memory studies and film studies, sets out an overview of the origins of, and recent and current shifts and trends within, research and scholarship at the interface between historical film audiences, the cinemagoing experience and memory; and presents the articles and reviews which follow within this frame. It considers some of the methodological issues raised by research in these areas and concludes by looking at some of the challenges facing future work in the field.";https://doi.org/10.1177/1750698016670783;yes;VRAI;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1750698016670783
On the quality of auxiliary assumptions;"In a recent contribution to this journal, David Trafimow and Joshua Uhalt (2015) argue against the tradeoff between predictive power and explanatory breadth. In their view, it is the quality of the auxiliary assumptions that allows one to make testable predictions; hence it is possible that theories of considerable explanatory breadth, when combined with the right quality auxiliary assumptions, lead to testable predictions. Unfortunately, they leave the notion quality unspecified. In this review, I consider three possible properties that might render auxiliary assumptions capable of yielding testable predictions, namely observability, detail, and precision. All three proposals are rejected. I end with an appeal to further reflect on the role of auxiliary assumptions in deriving testable predictions.";https://doi.org/10.1177/0959354316638764;yes;VRAI;https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/38/2/239.full.pdf
Business-to-business marketing and globalization: two of a kind;"Purpose - The aim of the &#34;viewpoint&#34; part of this paper is to enhance discussion on the challenges global business-to-business (B2B) marketing is facing. More specifically, academics are stimulated to study the impact of these trends on the internationalization of B2B companies. Managers are urged to engage in open strategy conversations on the consequent opportunities and threats for their global market strategy. Further, this paper acts as a &#34;Guest editorial&#34; for a special issue on 13213 and international business. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a literature screening of key contributions highlighting B2B marketing trends on the one hand and theoretical underpinnings of IB on the other. Starting from a practitioner perspective, the paper gradually introduces a discussion on the potential theoretical implications and on cross-fertilization possibilities when merging recent developments in B2B with theory and concepts from international business. Findings - B2B and IB go hand in hand and the actual challenges that business marketers encounter require critical revisions of core concepts and foundations of internationalization theories. Research limitations/implications - The paper identifies trends based on secondary data. They are exemplary and not exhaustive. Future research will have to empirically &#34;test&#34; these assertions. Practical implications - As a result of this paper, practitioners might question their internationalization or globalization approach. Originality/value - The value of the first part of the paper lies in the intended stimulus of academic and practitioner discussion. The second part draws attention on the special issue papers and their main messages.";https://doi.org/10.1108/02651330810904044;yes;VRAI;https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/35/5/945.full.pdf
Holocene comment and reply: the disappearance of **S. imbricatum** from European raised bogs: a comment on McClymont et al.;McClymont et al. (The Holocene 18 (2008) 9911002) present data on several environmental proxies to explore the disappearance of Sphagnum imbricatum from a peat bog in northern England, Wales and Ireland, respectively. McClymont et al. used their results to argue that a combination of rapid water-table rise and increased aeolian nutrient input from surrounding (agricultural) areas may have caused the disappearance of S. imbricatum from European raised bogs. The paper contributes to a growing body of literature focusing on the abrupt decline of S. imbricatum (S. austinii) AD 10001700. From the literature it becomes apparent that determining the exact mechanism for the decline of S. imbricatum (S. austinii) is difficult. Hence, many potential mechanisms have been suggested, amongst which increased wetness, increased interspecific competition, local burning and increased nutrient input are just a few examples. Although we do not comment on the quality of the science, there are a few things to be considered in order to get a complete picture.;https://doi.org/10.1177/0959683609345080;yes;VRAI;https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/47/3/1010.full.pdf
The changing face of respiratory physiology: 20 years of progress within the ERS: Clinical Physiology and Integrative Biology Assembly contribution to the celebration of 20 years of the ERS;"Respiratory physiology, the study of the function of the respiratory system in health and disease, was one of the core disciplines in respiratory medicine throughout the second half of the 20th Century. Moreover, clinical and basic physiologists were central to the creation of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) 20 yrs ago. Despite concerns that all the &#34;interesting&#34; questions in physiology had been answered, the last 20 yrs have shown that applying physiological principles to respiratory disease not only leads to new insights into how the lungs work when stressed, but has also identified new areas where the diagnosis and treatment of previously intractable or unrecognised physiological disorders has transformed the lives of large numbers of people.";https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00035310;yes;VRAI;https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/48/3/852.full.pdf
Paradigm shifts in lung cancer as defined in the new IASLC/ATS/ERS lung adenocarcinoma classification;The new international multidisciplinary lung adenocarcinoma classification is sponsored by the European Respiratory Society (ERS), as well as the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) [ 1]. This classification is now published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology, the official journal of the IASLC. Under the scientific oversight of the ATS and ERS, the classification project involved a systematic review to provide an evidence-based foundation with specific recommendations. For decades, the field of lung cancer has been relatively static with few major advances. However, in the past 56 yrs this has changed to a rapidly evolving field. At the heart of this change is the impact of the molecular discovery that the activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) are a marker for response and improved progression-free survival with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy compared to conventional chemotherapy in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients [ 2 5]. In this editorial, we summarise a series of major paradigm shifts that are outlined in this classification that will result in major changes in the approach to diagnosis of lung cancer compared to those outlined in previous World Health Organization (WHO) classifications. While this classification is primarily focused on lung adenocarcinoma, many of the recommendations will impact on how all histologic types of lung cancer are diagnosed in the future. This classification is divided into two major components: classification based on resection specimens ( table 1 ) and on small biopsies and cytology ( table 2 ).;https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00026711;yes;FAUX;

Translational research on prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitors;"Despite the fact that some have passed early phases of clinical trials, no prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitors are currently on the market. Yet, since 2003, there has been a boost in patent applications claiming prolyl oligopeptidase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer&#39;s and Parkinson&#39;s diseases, and other neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. While experts in the field call for innovative scaffolds to develop more potent inhibitors with more favorable properties, they also relate a lack of knowledge of the toxicology, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of existing compounds that hinders their assessment. Yet, with the current insights, it is difficult to correlate specific inhibitor effects with the postulated functions of prolyl oligopeptidase in the brain.";https://doi.org/10.1517/13543776.2011.587803;yes;VRAI;https://infectagentscancer.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1750-9378-8-39
Benefits of early hepatitis B immunization programs for newborns and infants;"Despite the availability of safe and effective hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines for &gt;20 years, strategies targeting risk groups failed to sufficiently control hepatitis B disease at the population level; this is mainly because of difficulties in risk identification and in program implementation. Hence, the global burden of disease of HBV still is substantial. The World Health Organization recommends universal vaccination against hepatitis B to ultimately eliminate HBV; this recommendation had been progressively implemented to reach 168 countries with a universal program by the end of 2006. However, hepatitis B immunization is currently becoming endangered of losing its place on the agendas of governments, agencies, and international organizations, mainly because of the increasing success of these immunization programs and the interest in newer vaccine-preventable diseases and the related programs. This publication aims to show that vaccination programs targeting newborns and infants are preferable to achieve this goal. The benefits of universal HBV vaccination for newborns and infants are: higher impact on chronic carrier rate and transmission; established potential of high vaccine coverage in this age group; opportunities to combine HBV vaccination with existing universal vaccination programs for newborns and infants; and impact on perinatal transmission, if vaccination is started shortly after birth. Moreover, the safety, immunogenicity, and long-term efficacy of newborn and infant HBV vaccination have been proven extensively. In summary, newborn and infant HBV vaccination programs should be considered the preferred strategy, capable of providing important and sustained impact on global HBV incidence, even if they have a delayed impact on sexual transmission of HBV.";https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e318173966f;yes;FAUX;

Tracers for biogenic secondary organic aerosol from $\alpha$-pinene and related monoterpenes;In this review, we first address the terpenoid composition of ambient fine rural aerosol to give a report on the current state of knowledge in regard to the molecular characterisation of biogenic secondary organic aerosol tracers. The major known, recently elucidated, and still unknown tracers, which can be detected at a significant relative abundance, are listed and briefly discussed. In a second part, we provide a historic account on the discovery of 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid, which involved a long search with several failures and a final success, and propose a revised formation pathway.

Impact of fully 4D reconstruction on kinetic parameter estimates;The spatiotemporal noise reduction of fully 4D reconstruction, in comparison to 3D reconstruction, has the potential to offer improved kinetic parameter estimates. These estimates should be as close to the ground truth as possible to achieve accurate quantification of function. Conventionally, the bias, coefficient of variation and error of these estimates are calculated based on simulated datasets, the latter defining the ground truth. One caveat of these simulations lies in the complexity to correctly model data acquired with a real PET tomograph. Due to this complexity, it is seldom possible to accurately model a PET tomograph. This work presents a list-mode subsets methodology for the use of real PET data in assessing the impact of fully 4D reconstruction on kinetic parameter estimates in comparison to conventional 3D reconstruction methods. Using high-resolution PET data from the HRRT, we demonstrate reduction in mean absolute error in BP estimates using fully 4D reconstruction compared to 3D reconstruction.;https://doi.org/10.1109/nssmic.2009.5401812;yes;VRAI;https://iris.unipa.it/bitstream/10447/99234/1/Ceritinib-Editorial.pdf
Hot recycling of bituminous mixtures;This chapter first presents the results of a survey performed on the practices used in Europe. This survey is considered a first report on the subject and could be usefully completed by the states of the art prepared in the framework of the Re-road and Direct-Mat European projects. Then the chapter addresses the key issue of Reclaimed Asphalt (RA) manufacture in laboratory considered within the group as an important point to assess recyclability of bituminous mixtures. To answer this question, common research has been launched on the basis of an interlaboratory test programme to set a relevant laboratory ageing of bituminous mixtures protocol. The choices of the tested protocol, the setting of the interlaboratory test programme as well as the results obtained, are presented in this chapter. A conclusion in the form of a recommendation for laboratory ageing of bituminous mixtures is given at the end of the chapter.;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-5104-0_7;yes;VRAI;http://www.jbsr.be/articles/10.5334/jbr-btr.954/galley/917/download/
DNA barcoding of amphibians and reptiles;"Only a few major research programs are currently targeting COI barcoding of amphibians and reptiles (including chelonians and crocodiles), two major groups of tetrapods. Amphibian and reptile species are typically old, strongly divergent, and contain deep conspecific lineages which might lead to problems in species assignment with incomplete reference databases. As far as known, there is no single pair of COI primers that will guarantee a sufficient rate of success across all amphibian and reptile taxa, or within major subclades of amphibians and reptiles, which means that the PCR amplification strategy needs to be adjusted depending on the specific research question. In general, many more amphibian and reptile taxa have been sequenced for 16S rDNA, which for some purposes may be a suitable complementary marker, at least until a more comprehensive COI reference database becomes available. DNA barcoding has successfully been used to identify amphibian larval stages (tadpoles) in species-rich tropical assemblages. Tissue sampling, DNA extraction, and amplification of COI is straightforward in amphibians and reptiles. Single primer pairs are likely to have a failure rate between 5 and 50% if taxa of a wide taxonomic range are targeted; in such cases the use of primer cocktails or subsequent hierarchical usage of different primer pairs is necessary. If the target group is taxonomically limited, many studies have followed a strategy of designing specific primers which then allow an easy and reliable amplification of all samples.";https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-61779-591-6_5;yes;VRAI;http://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/annuaire/2015-n58-annuaire02870/1038325ar.pdf
