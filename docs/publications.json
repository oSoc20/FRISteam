A method for the simultaneous measurement of exposure biomarkers of di(2-propylheptyl) phthalate (DPHP), di(isononyl)cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (DINCH), di(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DEHTP) and di-2-ethylhexyl adipate (DEHA) in hair samples was developed and validated in this study. Prior to the analysis, the hair samples were washed in acetone and ultrapure water and pulverized to powder. Further, a solid-liquid and solid-phase extraction, followed by quantification using liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed. The method was validated in terms of recovery, matrix effects, carry-over, linearity, limits of quantification, within- and between-run precision and trueness. Satisfying results were obtained for all targeted compounds, except for mono(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (MEHA), which was monitored only qualitatively. The optimized method was implemented in a pilot biomonitoring study with hair samples from 9 healthy volunteers. Detection frequencies of seven metabolites ranged from 11% to 100%. Mono(2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (MEHTP) and mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) adipate (oxo-MEHA) were found in all hair samples. More hydrophobic monoester metabolites were found to be incorporated in hair to a greater extent compared to their oxidized counterparts. Obtained results show that the developed method can detect AP metabolites in hair, supporting the use of this alternative matrix in human biomonitoring."}}{"id": "115f7b19-90df-459e-88f7-abe87ca1b695", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157594", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Overcoming intrinsic and acquired cetuximab resistance in RAS wild-type colorectal cancer", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers11010098", "abstract": {"id": 164968693, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important therapeutic target in colorectal cancer (CRC). After the initial promising results of EGFR-targeted therapies such as cetuximab, therapeutic resistance poses a challenging problem and limits the success of effective anti-EGFR cancer therapies in the clinic. In order to overcome resistance to these EGFR-targeted therapies, new treatment options are necessary. The objective of this study was to investigate the expression of human epidermal growth factor (HER) receptors and the efficacy of afatinib, a second-generation irreversible EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in RAS wild-type CRC cell lines with different cetuximab sensitivities. CRC cell lines with different sensitivities to cetuximab showed rather low EGFR expression but high HER2 and HER3 expression. These results were in line with the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data from CRC patients, where higher mRNA levels of HER2 and HER3 were also detected compared to EGFR. Therefore, the targets of afatinib were indeed expressed on the CRC cell lines used in this study and in CRC patients. Furthermore, cetuximab resistance had no significant influence on the expression levels of HER receptors in CRC cell lines (p &amp;gt;&amp;#61; 0.652). This study also demonstrated that afatinib was able to induce a concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect in RAS wild-type CRC cell lines with different cetuximab sensitivities. Neither cetuximab resistance (p &amp;#61; 0.233) nor hypoxia (p &amp;#61; 0.157) significantly influenced afatinib&amp;#39;s cytotoxic effect. In conclusion, our preclinical data support the hypothesis that treatment with afatinib might be a promising novel therapeutic strategy for CRC patients experiencing intrinsic and acquired cetuximab resistance."}}{"id": "ff6809c6-b49a-475c-8936-5005918a153a", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157584", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Schwarz on tax treaties, 5th Edition", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": null, "abstract": null}{"id": "ec688e0a-ab52-4927-95ed-d08f76d2e2e9", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157560", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Methylglyoxal, a glycolysis metabolite, triggers metastasis through MEK/ERK/SMAD1 pathway activation in breast cancer", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13058-018-1095-7", "abstract": {"id": 164966049, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "BackgroundElevated aerobic glycolysis rate is a biochemical alteration associated with malignant transformation and cancer progression. This metabolic shift unavoidably generates methylglyoxal (MG), a potent inducer of dicarbonyl stress through the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). We have previously shown that the silencing of glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), the main MG detoxifying enzyme, generates endogenous dicarbonyl stress resulting in enhanced growth and metastasis in vivo. However, the molecular mechanisms through which MG stress promotes metastasis development remain to be unveiled.MethodsIn this study, we used RNA sequencing analysis to investigate gene-expression profiling of GLO1-depleted breast cancer cells and we validated the regulated expression of selected genes of interest by RT-qPCR. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we demonstrated the acquisition of a pro-metastatic phenotype related to dicarbonyl stress in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MCF7 breast cancer cellular models. Hyperactivation of MEK/ERK/SMAD1 pathway was evidenced using western blotting upon endogenous MG stress and exogenous MG treatment conditions. MEK and SMAD1 regulation of MG pro-metastatic signature genes in breast cancer cells was demonstrated by RT-qPCR.ResultsHigh-throughput transcriptome profiling of GLO1-depleted breast cancer cells highlighted a pro-metastatic signature that establishes novel connections between MG dicarbonyl stress, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling by neoplastic cells and enhanced cell migration. Mechanistically, we showed that these metastasis-related processes are functionally linked to MEK/ERK/SMAD1 cascade activation in breast cancer cells. We showed that sustained MEK/ERK activation in GLO1-depleted cells notably occurred through the down-regulation of the expression of dual specificity phosphatases in MG-stressed breast cancer cells. The use of carnosine and aminoguanidine, two potent MG scavengers, reversed MG stress effects in in vitro and in vivo experimental settings.ConclusionsThese results uncover for the first time the key role of MG dicarbonyl stress in the induction of ECM remodeling and the activation of migratory signaling pathways, both in favor of enhanced metastatic dissemination of breast cancer cells. Importantly, the efficient inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling using MG scavengers further emphasizes the need to investigate their therapeutic potential across different malignancies."}}{"id": "2fa6e1f8-438f-40d5-9a69-8fcb64168448", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157546", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Short communication", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2018-15514", "abstract": {"id": 164961353, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "Both the sensitivity of an estrus detection system and the consistency of alarms relative to ovulation determine its value for a farmer. The objective of this study was to compare an activity-based system and a milk progesterone-based system for their ability to detect estrus reliably, and to investigate how their alerts are linked to the time of the LH surge preceding ovulation. The study was conducted on an experimental research farm in Flanders, Belgium. The activity alerts were generated by a commercial activity meter (ActoFIT, DeLaval, Tumba, Sweden), and milk progesterone was measured using a commercial ELISA kit. Sensitivity and positive predictive value of both systems were calculated based on 35 estrus periods over 43 d. Blood samples were taken for determination of the LH surge, and the intervals between timing of the alerts and the LH surge were investigated based on their range and standard deviation (SD). Activity alerts had a sensitivity of 80% and a positive predictive value of 65.9%. Alerts were detected from 39 h before until 8 h after the LH surge (range: 47 h, SD: 16 h). Alerts based on milk progesterone were obtained from a recently developed monitoring algorithm using a mathematical model and synergistic control. All estruses were correctly identified by this algorithm, and the LH surge followed, on average, 62 h later. Using the mathematical model, model-based indicators for the estimation of ovulation time can be calculated. Depending on which modelbased indicator was used, ranges of 33 to 35 h and SD of about 11 h were obtained. Because detection of the LH surge was very labor intensive, only a limited number of potential estrus periods could be studied."}}{"id": "44202fab-c697-44e2-a79d-209098293718", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157541", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Transmission electron microscopy study of complex oxide scales on DIN 1.4970 steel exposed to liquid Pb-Bi eutectic", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.corsci.2018.10.018", "abstract": {"id": 164961292, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "The deployment of Gen-IV lead-cooled fast reactors requires a good compatibility between the selected structural/cladding steels and the inherently corrosive heavy liquid metal coolant.

Methods: A convenience sample of 108 persons with MS was studied, distinguished in three disability subgroups based on Disease Steps (DS). Health condition was assessed by standardized clinical tests about physical, cognitive and psychosocial functioning. Contextual factors (personal and environmental) were collected. Activity-related travel diaries and GPS tracking devices were used to investigate activity-related travel behaviour in terms of number of trips and transport modes used. The influence of health condition measures and contextual factors with activityrelated travel behaviour measures was analyzed using Spearman correlations and multiple linear regressions. Results: 1. Activity-related travel behaviour in MS decreased significantly with increasing ambulatory dysfunction. Significant changes were found regarding travel modes, number, type and planning of activities. 2. Activity-related travel behaviour in MS correlated with both health condition measures and contextual factors. A limited number of standardized tests of health condition and contextual factors (driving ability, household size) can predict activity-related travel behaviour in MS. Conclusions: Both health condition (mostly physical functioning) and contextual factors are predictive for activity-related travel behaviour in MS.

The purpose of this paper is to diagnose and detect the bursting of shipping bubbles ex ante, and to qualify the patterns of shipping price dynamics and the bubble mechanics, so that appropriate counter measures can be taken in advance to reduce side effects arising from bubbles. Design/methodology/approach - Log periodic power law (LPPL) model, developed in the past decade, is used to detect large market falls or &amp;#34;crashes&amp;#34; through modeling of the shipping price dynamics on a selection of three historical shipping bubbles over the period of 1985 to 2016. The method is based on a nonlinear least squares estimation that yields predictions of the most probable time of the regime switching. Findings - It could be concluded that predictions by the LPPL model are quite dependent on the time at which they are conducted. Interestingly, the LPPL model could have predicted the substantial fall in the Baltic Dry Index during the recent global downturn, but not all crashes in the past. It is also found that the key ingredient that sets off an unsustainable growth process for shipping prices is the positive feedback. When the positive feedback starts, the burst of bubbles in shipping would be influenced by both endogenous and exogenous factors, which are crucial for the advanced warning of the market conversion. Originality/value - The LPPL model has been first applied into the dry bulk shipping market to test a couple of shipping bubbles. The authors not only assess the predictability and robustness of the LPPL model but also expand the understanding of the model and explain patterns of shipping price dynamics and bubble mechanics."}}{"id": "46444df7-ad5c-4a5e-8c4b-e9746831e2de", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157650", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Effect of foliar bio-fertilization on growth and biochemical parameters of olive trees at flowering", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2018.1500592", "abstract": {"id": 164911900, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "Growth and biochemical parameters of leaves, flower buds and flowers of olive (Olea europaea L. cv.

The importance of genetic and environmental factors to these associations is unclear. Objective: The objective was to examine the importance of genetic and environmental factors in the associations between infant growth and adult cardiometabolic risk factors (anthropometric characteristics, lipids, insulin sensitivity, leptin, blood pressure, and fibrinogen) in twins. Design: Cardiometabolic risk factors were assessed in 240 twin pairs (aged 1834 y) from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. Infant growth was defined as change in weight z score. We regressed intrapair differences in growth during 4 growth windows (01, 16, 612, and 1224 mo) against intrapair differences in the risk factors in monozygotic and dizygotic twins separately. Results: Within monozygotic twin pairs only, associations between infant growth and most adult lipids, glucose, leptin, and blood pressure (eg, systolic blood pressure: b &amp;#61; 5.95 mm Hg per change in z score, P &amp;#61; 0.01 in monozygotic twins; b &amp;#61; \u00e2\u02c6\u20191.64, P &amp;#61; 0.82 in dizygotic twins from 12 to 24 mo) were found.

We evaluated whether neonatal sepsis can be predicted from antepartum parameters in these women. Study design We used multivariable logistic regression to develop a prediction model. Data were obtained from two recent randomized controlled trials on induction of labor versus expectant management in late preterm PROM (PPROMEXIL trials, (ISRCTN29313500 and ISRCTN05689407). Data from randomized as well as non-randomized women, who consented to the use of their medical data, were used. We evaluated 13 potential antepartum predictors for neonatal sepsis. Missing data were imputed. Discriminative ability of the model was expressed as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and a calibration with both a calibration plot and the Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Overall performance of the prediction model was quantified as the scaled Brier score. Results We studied 970 women. Thirty-three (3.4%) neonates suffered neonatal sepsis. Maternal age (OR 1.09 per year), maternal CRP level (OR 1.01 per mmol/l), maternal temperature (OR 1.80 per \u00c2\u00b0C) and positive GBS culture (OR 2.20) were associated with an increased risk of neonatal sepsis. The model had an area under the ROC-curve of 0.71. The model had both a good calibration and accuracy.

Methods and Results Data were retrospectively collected from September 1989 until July 2011 of all IPF patients registered for LTX in the Netherlands. Patients were included after revision of the diagnosis based on the criteria set by the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT. Trajectory data, clinical data at time of screening, and donor data were collected. In total, 98 IPF patients were listed for LTX. During the waiting list period, 30 % of the patients died. Mean pulmonary artery pressure, 6-min walking distance, and the use of supplemental oxygen were significant predictors of mortality on the waiting list. Fifty-two patients received LTX with a median overall survival after transplantation of 10 years. Conclusions This study demonstrated a 10-year survival time after LTX in IPF. Furthermore, our study demonstrated a significantly better survival after bilateral LTX in IPF compared to single LTX although bilateral LTX patients were significantly younger."}}{"id": "ba82c1a7-16d1-4518-a6b2-de9428ea7bef", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157308", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Extensive pulmonary sarcoid reaction in a patient with bmpr-2 associated idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": null, "abstract": {"id": 164471837, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive life-threatening disease characterized by vascular remodeling.

Most previous studies have reported improved HRQoL shortly after LTx. With regard to long-term effects on HRQoL, however, the evidence is less solid. This prospective cohort study was started with 828 patients who were on the waiting list for LTx. Then, in a longitudinal follow-up, 370 post-LTx patients were evaluated annually for up to 15years. For all wait-listed and follow-up patients, the following four HRQoL instruments were administered: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, Nottingham Health Profile, and a visual analogue scale. Cross-sectional and generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis for repeated measures were performed to assess changes in HRQoL during follow-up. After LTx, patients showed improvement in all HRQoL domains except pain, which remained steady throughout the long-term follow-up. The level of anxiety and depressive symptoms decreased significantly and remained constant. In conclusion, this study showed that HRQoL improves after LTx and tends to remain relatively constant for the entire life span.

The analysis revealed that organic-neurogenic FAS is more frequent in women than in men. In organic-neurogenic FAS over half of the patients acquired the foreign accent after a stroke. Their lesions are typically located in the left supratentorial regions of the brain, and generally involve the primary motor cortex and premotor cortex (BA 4 and 6), and/or the basal ganglia. Although neurocognitive data are not consistently reported, vascular FAS patients regularly suffer frontal executive dysfunctions. On the basis of a careful comparison of the cognitive and theoretical accounts of FAS, AoS and ataxic dysarthria, it is concluded that FAS should be regarded a dual component motor speech disorder in which both planning and motor execution of speech may be affected."}}{"id": "7b76b366-a103-4545-ba3b-9ac2f2c7f4ec", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:153457", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Qualitative comparative analysis as an evaluation tool", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1098214017710502", "abstract": {"id": 164470329, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is gaining ground in evaluation circles, but the number of applications is still limited.

Together, through cooperation, economies of scale can be realised that facilitate a modal shift away from road to a more efficient and more sustainable transport. This would reduce the cost of transport to/from the hinterland region from/to these ports consequently increasing the attractiveness and the market share of the cooperating ports for this region. The paper describes a conceptual method to identify and quantify the opportunities for cooperation in the hinterland. The framework starts, after some basic transport economic concepts, from (theoretically available) hinterland data to locate regions that are at the edge of the contested hinterland of a port region and results in a methodology that can be used to generate a quantified list of regions where cooperation will make a difference. Using this methodology, port authorities (PAs), of any region where hinterland data are available, can list, together with their neighbours, the regions where to prioritise their efforts."}}{"id": "afd33f8d-c318-4edd-8273-aeaa03ade14f", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:156823", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Re-imagining DEFA.

Competition had relatively little effect on growth of both species at current climate, independent of O3 treatment. In contrast, competitive effect of both plant species considerably increased under FC, and especially FC &amp;#43; O3 conditions, when growth of mixed-culture rape reduced up to 48% and that of wild mustard up to 80%. The mechanisms of elevated competitiveness of rape under the future climate consisted of better antioxidative protection, particularly elevated total antioxidative capacity and activities of peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase. Whereas stronger oxidative damage, disproportionally high activities of H2O2 scavenging enzymes and lower pool of soluble sugars in mixed-culture wild mustard reduced its competitiveness under FC &amp;#43; O3 conditions. In conclusion it must be pointed out, that regardless improved competitive abilities of rape under FC and FC &amp;#43; O3 conditions, competition with wild mustard reduced growth, indicating increased weed-induced yield losses in the future climate, especially with concomitant intensification of O3 pollution."}}{"id": "649c0582-0ab4-48d8-8fce-c8c86fef4431", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:157239", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Phytochemical characterization and comparative studies of four Cecropia species collected in Panama using multivariate data analysis", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-38334-4", "abstract": {"id": 164259878, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "Plant species of the genus Cecropia (Urticaceae) are used as traditional medicine in Latin-America, and are commercially available as food supplements.

Forty-seven compounds were fully identified or tentatively characterized. Thirty-nine of these have not been previously reported for the species under investigation. Multivariate analysis revelead that C. obtusifolia and C. insignis are the most related species, while C. hispidissima is the most segregated one. Considering the importance of the description of novel chemical entities and the increasing interest and use of natural products, this study may be of great help for chemotaxonomic purposes, the interpretation of medicinal properties and for quality assessment of herbal supplements containing Cecropia leaves."}}{"id": "ebc1e2b0-3451-47ae-9a14-d18fc8e79dba", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:158044", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Poems from The Auroras of Autumn: &amp;#34;The Novel&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Study of Images I&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Study of Images II&amp;#34;", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1353/wsj.2019.0005", "abstract": null}{"id": "76f2d866-f118-464a-85ef-685231c7e576", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:158032", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": null, "dutchTitle": "Een topje van de ijsberg?

The coefficient of variation (CV &amp;#61; standard deviation \u00c3\u2014 mean\u00e2\u02c6\u20191) is still one of the most commonly used indices to assess temporal variability, despite being known to present several problems on its assessment (e.g., mean dependence or high sensitivity to rare events). The proportional variability (PV) index was developed to solve some of the CV&amp;#39;s drawbacks, but, so far, no variability index takes into account the chronological order of the values in time series. In this paper, we introduce the consecutive disparity index (D), a temporal variability index that takes into account the chronological order of the values, assessing the average rate of change between consecutive values. We used computer simulations and empirical data for fruit production in trees, bird counts, and rodent captures to compare the behavior of D, PV, and CV under different scenarios. D was sensitive to changes in temporal autocorrelation in the negative autocorrelation range, and CV and PV were sensitive in the positive autocorrelation range despite not considering the chronological order of the values. The CV, however, was highly dependent on the mean of the time series, while D and PV were not. Our results demonstrate that, like PV, D solves many of the problems of the CV index while taking into account the chronological order of values in time series. The mathematical and statistical features of D make it a suitable index for analyzing temporal variability in a wide range of ecological studies."}}{"id": "f831d872-5818-4b73-bf68-974ed8dd1551", "englishKeywords": [], "dutchKeywords": [], "dataProvider": {"id": "c:irua:156086", "name": "UAntwerpen"}, "title": {"englishTitle": "Citizenship as a gift", "dutchTitle": null}, "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13621025.2018.1561827", "abstract": {"id": 165205670, "dutchAbstract": null, "englishAbstract": "While citizenship scholars have documented the increasing moralisation of immigration and integration policies, relatively few have explored how immigrants themselves make sense of their (partial) membership of European welfare states.

We focus on one dimension of their experiences: their stigmatic dependency upon the Belgian welfare state. While their accounts can be partly understood as reproducing neoliberal discourses, we argue that they are also a strategic reaction against the dependency that is inadvertently created by European welfare states.

The innate immune system is activated by the interaction of pathogen-associated molecular patterns of microorganisms with Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Activation of innate immunity via TLRs was shown to be a barrier to the induction of transplantation tolerance after lung transplantation. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in 10 genes coding for TLR1 to TLR1 0 might contribute to an altered immune response and the subsequent development of BOS. METHODS: DNA was collected from 110 lung transplant recipients. Twenty patients developed BOS. The control group comprised 422 individuals. Sixty-four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 genes coding for TLR10 to TLR10 were genotyped. RESULTS: The genotype distribution of TLR2 (rs1898830 and rs7656411), TLR4 (rs1927911) and TLR9 (rs352162 and rs187084) was significantly different between BOSpos patients and BOSneg patients and controls. The BOSpos group had significantly more patients with 3 or 4 of these risk alleles compared with the BOSneg and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 that recognize bacterial and viral pathogens are associated with BOS after lung transplantation.

Chemokines such as thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) are produced locally in the lung and attract T cells via chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4). In a TARC gradient, cells expressing CCR4(&amp;#43;&amp;#43;) migrate more efficiently than CCR4(&amp;#43;)-expressing cells. In this study, we compared the CCR4 expression of T cells in blood from 20 lung transplant recipients to healthy controls. We then examined whether CCR4 expression is associated with the occurrence of chronic rejection. The CCR4(&amp;#43;&amp;#43;) expression was decreased on CD4 T cells from LTx patients (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) when compared to healthy controls. The analysis of CD4 T cell subsets showed that this decrease was present on centralmemory, effector memory and terminally differentiated T cells (P &amp;#61; 0.0007, P &amp;lt; 0.0001 and P &amp;#61; 0.05, respectively), while a trend was found for naive CD4 T cells (P &amp;#61; 0.06). Also, the expression of CCR4(&amp;#43;) on regulatory T cells (T(regs)) was decreased in LTx patients when compared to healthy controls (P &amp;#61; 0.02). Interestingly, the CCR4(&amp;#43;&amp;#43;) expression on CD4 effector memory T cells was decreased in patients developing chronic rejection sometimes more than a year before the clinical diagnosis when compared to patients who did not (P &amp;#61; 0.04). The analysis of CD8 T cell subsets only showed the CCR4(&amp;#43;) expression to be increased significantly on effector memory and terminally differentiated CD8 T cells (P &amp;#61; 0.02, P &amp;#61; 0.03, respectively) in LTx patients, but no relation was found in chronic rejection.
