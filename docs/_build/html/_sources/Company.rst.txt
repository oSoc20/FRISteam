The FRIS portal research
========================


Flanders is a rich source of expertise. Every year there are about 3,000 current research projects and more than 30,000 scientific publications are published. The FRIS Research Portal offers you a unique view of publicly funded research in Flanders. The portal is a source of inspiration for reporting, analysis and statistics. In this way we can improve policy making and respond better to trends in society.

In addition, FRIS aims to bring researchers closer together, encourage interdisciplinary research, enable networking between researchers and help to find experts in certain disciplines.

Thanks to a direct integration with the systems of the scientific institutions, FRIS can offer you the most recent data. A change in the database of a research center is immediately implemented on the portal. We are proud that all information about researchers, research groups, publicly funded projects and all publications from 2008 onwards is accessible to everyone.

The FRIS Research portal brings a lot of new features and changes, including a new search functionality that can be triggered from each page on our web-site, and an expertfinder where you can browse through a list of classifications to find an expert in your domain.
